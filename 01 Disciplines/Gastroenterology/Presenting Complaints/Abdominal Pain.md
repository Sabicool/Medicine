# Phone Call/Presentation Questions
- SOCRATES of the pain
	- Character of the pain
	- How severe is the pain
	- Where is the main site of pain; is it localised or generalised
	- Changes in vital signs such as fever, tachycardia or hypotension?
	- Associated symptoms (e.g. nausea, vomiting, distention, constipation or dysuria)
	- Has the patient had past or recent abdominal surgery?
	- What was the reason for admission?
	- Is the patient on steroids or immunosuppressed?
	- Is this a new problem? Has it occurred before?
# Common Causes *(Corridor Thoughts)*
- Can be broadly grouped into surgical and medical

> [!NOTE] Medical Causes of Acute Abdominal Pain
> - Thoracic
> 	- MI, pericarditis
> 	- PE, pleurisy, pneumonia
> 	- Aortic dissection
> - Abdominal
> 	- Hepatitis, right heart failure
> 	- Infection including gastroenteritis, pyelonephritis, cystitis, bacterial colitis and peritonitis
> 	- Intestinal ischaemia from atheroma, vasculitis, Henoch–Schönlein purpura or sickle cell disease
> 	- Reflux, peptic ulcer disease, inflammatory bowel disease
> - Endocrine and metabolic
> 	- DKA
> 	- Addison's disease
> 	- Hypercalcaemia
> 	- Lead poisoning, paracetamol or iron poisoning
> - Neurogenic
> 	- Herpes zoster
> 	- Radiculitis from spinal cord pathology
> 	- Tabes dorsalis
> - Thoracolumbar spine
> 	- Collapsed/fractured vertebra from osteoporosis, neoplasm or infection (e.g. TB)

> [!NOTE] Surgical Causes of Acute Abdominal Pain
> - Gastrointestinal
> 	- Oesophageal cancer
> 	- Gastric cancer
> 	- Gallbladder: biliary colic, acute cholecystitis, ascending cholangitis
> 	- Pancreatitis
> 	- Liver: subphrenic abscess, hepatic abscess
> 	- Spleen: rupture, abscess
> 	- Small intestine: intussusception, obstruction, perforation, ischaemia
> 	- Large intestine: obstruction, perforation, diverticulitis, ischaemic colitis
> 	- Appendix: appendicitis, appendacaecal abscess
> 	- Mesenteric adenitis
> 	- Hernia
> - Urological
> 	- Renal: renal colic, ureteric colic
> 	- Bladder: urinary retention
> 	- Testicles: torsion, epididymitis, cancer
> - Vascular:
> 	- AAA
> - Gynaecological:
> 	- Uterine: bleed into fibroid, pregnancy-related
> 	- Ovarian: torsion, ruptured cyst, haemorrhage, cancer
> 	- Fallopian tube: Ectopic pregnancy, pelvic inflammatory disease
> 	- Mittelschmerz, endometriosis
> - Musculoskeletal
> 	- Rectus muscle haematoma or tear

> [!Warning] Major Threat to Life
> - Exansanguinating haemorrhage with hypovolaemic shock
> 	- Leaking AAA, ruptured ectopic pregnancy or splenic rupture
> 	- Consider iatrogenic causes (e.g. liver or renal biopsy, thoracocentesis)
> - Perforated viscus
> 	- Rigid abdomen with severe pain
> - Necrosis of viscus
> 	- Severe pancreatitis, intussusception, volvulus, strangulated hernia or ischaemic colitis can rapidly cause hypovolaemic or septic shock and electrolyte and acid-base disturbances
> - Intraperitoneal septic focus
> 	- Infection from a localised site such as ascending cholangitis or an infected obstructed kidney may progress to generalised septic shock within hours
> - Extra-abdominal causes
> 	- Patients with AMI, thoracic aortic dissection and/or DKA may present with acute abdominal pain
# Assessment
## End of Bed
- Patients with severe colic are often restless and writhing in discomfort
- Patients with peritonitis lie still avoiding any movement
## A to E Assessment
- Heart rate and blood pressure?
	- Tachycardia (HR >120) + Hypovolaemia (SBP <90mmHg) is associated with shock
	- Sudden abdominal pain associated with hypotension consider: inferior MI (do ECG), pancreatitis (measure lipase), ruptured AAA or ectopic pregnanct (urgent USS/FAST) and mesenteric infarction (bloody diarrhoea with a metabolic acidosis and raised lactate)
	- Gradual onset abdomen with hypotension consider: peritonitis, perforation or urosepsis
	- Recheck the BP and HR with the patient standing if the supine BP is normal => A ↓ BP with ↑ HR (>20 beats/min) => underlying hypovolaemia
- Respiratory rate?
	- Shallow, rapid breathing consider generalised abdominal pain, peritonitis or subdiaphragmatic irritation
	- Sustained tachypnoea is associated with sepsis, metabolic acidosis, anaemia, pneumonia and CCF
- Temperature?
	- Fever consider infection or inflammation
# Selective History and Chart Review
- Onset gradual or sudden?
	- Sudden onset => Perforation of a viscus, ruptured ectopic pregnancy, torsion of an ovarian cyst or a leaking AAA
	- Severe pain in waves that develops over minutes to hours => colic (renal, biliary or intestinal)
- Character?
	- Burning => peptic ulcer
	- Sharp and constricting ('takes one's breath away') => Biliary colic
	- Deep and agonising, eased by sitting forwards => Acute pancreatitis
	- Gripping with intermittent exacerbations => Bowel obstruction
	- Relentness and worsened on coughing or moving; the patient prefers to lie still => Peritonitis
	- Patient rolls around trying to get comfy => Ureteric colic
- Location?
	- May need to find localisation by examination
- Does the pain radiate
	![[Pasted image 20250914185830.png]]
- Has the pain changed since onset?
	- A ruptured viscus is initially associated with localised pain that subsequently shifts or becomes generalised
- Aggravating or relieving factors?
	-  Duodenal ulcer pain is often relieved by the ingestion of food.
	- Pancreatitis pain is worsened after eating and may be relieved by sitting up or leaning forwards
	- Pain that increases with inspiration suggests biliary origin, peritonitis or pleurisy
	- Pain associated with frequency and dysuria aggravated by micturition suggests a urological cause
	- Pain worse with movement such as coughing is usually secondary to localised or generalised peritonitis (e.g. appendicitis)
	- Pain relieved by movement or that makes the patient restless is more often colicky in nature (e.g. ureteric colic)
- Other associated symptoms?
	- Nausea or vomiting?
		- Pain prior to nausea and vomiting => surgical acute abdomen
		- Pain following nausea and vomiting => gastritis or gastroenteritis
		- Vomiting that occurs at the onset of pain => peritoneal irritation, perforation of a viscus, acute pancreatitis or a high intestinal obstruction
		- Vomting many hours after the onset of abdominal pain may be caused by lower intestinal obstruction or ileus
		- Vomiting after fasting => gastric stasis or gastric outlet obstruction
	- Contents of vomiting?
		- Clear fluids => obstruction proximal to sphincter of Oddi in the second part of the duodenum
		- Faeculent vomit => distal intestinal obstruction or a gastrocolic fistula
		- Blood => see [[Haematemesis]]
	- Frequency and character of stool?
		- Bloody diarrhoea with abdominal pain => invasive enteritis (e.g. Shigella and Salmonella), ischaemic colitis and inflammatory bowel disease
		- Diarrhoea alternating with constipation => diverticular disease, colonic neoplasm
		- Absolute constipation with lack of flatus => low large bowel obstruction or ileus
	- Fever or chills?
		- Check temperature record since admission and check medication sheet for antipyretic or steroid use which may mask a fever
- Documentation review
	- Is there a history of abdominal pain?
		- Consider: Gastritis or oesophageal reflux, peptic ulcer disease, alcoholic pancreatitis, cholelithiasis, uretoerolithiasis
	- Is there a history of previous abdominal surgery? => adhesions
	- Recent history of blunt trauma to the abdomen
		- Contained subcapsular haematoma of the spleen may rupture several days later
		- Abnormal spleen in infectious mononucleosis, malaria or a lymphoproliferative disorder can rupture with minimal or even no obvious trauma
	- Is there a history of chronic liver disease from alcohol, viral hepatitis or non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH)
		- Always consider spontaneous bacterial peritonitis in a patient with chronic liver disease, ascites and fever
	- Is there a history of coronary or peripheral vascular disease?
		- Abdominal pain from an inferior MI, leaking AAA, mesenteric infarction or descending aortic dissection (with hypertension)
	- Could the patient be pregnant?
	- What medication is the patient currently prescribed?
		- Anticoagulants, NSAIDs and steroids?

## Abdominal Examination
- Inspection
	- Scars
	- Abdominal distension
	- Ascites
	- Bruising to flanks or umbilicus (e.g. Grey-Turner''s sign or Cullen's sign)
- Palpation
	- Palpate quadrants away from point of maximal pain 
	- Check for guarding
	- Check for rebound tenderness
	- Combination of a rigid abdomen, guarding and percussion tenderness => peritonitis
	- Test for shifting dullness
	- Check all hernial orifices
- Percussion
	- Tympanic => bowel obstruction
- Auscultation
	- Tinkling bowel sounds => mechanical bowel obstruction
	- Absent bowel sounds => Paralytic ileus or generalised peritonitis
- DRE with chaperone if indicated
- Pelvic exam if indicated
- Special signs:
	- Murphy's sign, psoas sign, obturator sign, rosving's sign
# Investigations
