# Phone Call/Presentation Questions
- SOCRATES of the pain
	- Character of the pain
	- How severe is the pain
	- Where is the main site of pain; is it localised or generalised
	- Changes in vital signs such as fever, tachycardia or hypotension?
	- Associated symptoms (e.g. nausea, vomiting, distention, constipation or dysuria)
	- Has the patient had past or recent abdominal surgery?
	- What was the reason for admission?
	- Is the patient on steroids or immunosuppressed?
	- Is this a new problem? Has it occurred before?
# Common Causes *(Corridor Thoughts)*
- Can be broadly grouped into surgical and medical

> [!NOTE] Medical Causes of Acute Abdominal Pain
> - Thoracic
> 	- MI, pericarditis
> 	- PE, pleurisy, pneumonia
> 	- Aortic dissection
> - Abdominal
> 	- Hepatitis, right heart failure
> 	- Infection including gastroenteritis, pyelonephritis, cystitis, bacterial colitis and peritonitis
> 	- Intestinal ischaemia from atheroma, vasculitis, Henoch–Schönlein purpura or sickle cell disease
> 	- Reflux, peptic ulcer disease, inflammatory bowel disease
> - Endocrine and metabolic
> 	- DKA
> 	- Addison's disease
> 	- Hypercalcaemia
> 	- Lead poisoning, paracetamol or iron poisoning
> - Neurogenic
> 	- Herpes zoster
> 	- Radiculitis from spinal cord pathology
> 	- Tabes dorsalis
> - Thoracolumbar spine
> 	- Collapsed/fractured vertebra from osteoporosis, neoplasm or infection (e.g. TB)

> [!NOTE] Surgical Causes of Acute Abdominal Pain
> - Gastrointestinal
> 	- Oesophageal cancer
> 	- Gastric cancer
> 	- Gallbladder: biliary colic, acute cholecystitis, ascending cholangitis
> 	- Pancreatitis
> 	- Liver: subphrenic abscess, hepatic abscess
> 	- Spleen: rupture, abscess
> 	- Small intestine: intussusception, obstruction, perforation, ischaemia
> 	- Large intestine: obstruction, perforation, diverticulitis, ischaemic colitis
> 	- Appendix: appendicitis, appendacaecal abscess
> 	- Mesenteric adenitis
> 	- Hernia
> - Urological
> 	- Renal: renal colic, ureteric colic
> 	- Bladder: urinary retention
> 	- Testicles: torsion, epididymitis, cancer
> - Vascular:
> 	- AAA
> - Gynaecological:
> 	- Uterine: bleed into fibroid, pregnancy-related
> 	- Ovarian: torsion, ruptured cyst, haemorrhage, cancer
> 	- Fallopian tube: Ectopic pregnancy, pelvic inflammatory disease
> 	- Mittelschmerz, endometriosis
> - Musculoskeletal
> 	- Rectus muscle haematoma or tear

> [!Warning] Major Threat to Life
> - Exansanguinating haemorrhage with hypovolaemic shock
> 	- Leaking AAA, ruptured ectopic pregnancy or splenic rupture
> 	- Consider iatrogenic causes (e.g. liver or renal biopsy, thoracocentesis)
> - Perforated viscus
> 	- Rigid abdomen with severe pain
> - Necrosis of viscus
> 	- Severe pancreatitis, intussusception, volvulus, strangulated hernia or ischaemic colitis can rapidly cause hypovolaemic or septic shock and electrolyte and acid-base disturbances
> - Intraperitoneal septic focus
> 	- Infection from a localised site such as ascending cholangitis or an infected obstructed kidney may progress to generalised septic shock within hours
> - Extra-abdominal causes
> 	- Patients with AMI, thoracic aortic dissection and/or DKA may present with acute abdominal pain
# Assessment
## End of Bed
- Patients with severe colic are often restless and writhing in discomfort
- Patients with peritonitis lie still avoiding any movement
## A to E Assessment
- Heart rate and blood pressure?
	- Tachycardia (HR >120) + Hypovolaemia (SBP <90mmHg) is associated with shock
	- Sudden abdominal pain associated with hypotension consider: inferior MI (do ECG), pancreatitis (measure lipase), ruptured AAA or ectopic pregnanct (urgent USS/FAST) and mesenteric infarction (bloody diarrhoea with a metabolic acidosis and raised lactate)
	- Gradual onset abdomen with hypotension consider: peritonitis, perforation or urosepsis
	- Recheck the BP and HR with the patient standing if the supine BP is normal => A ↓ BP with ↑ HR (>20 beats/min) => underlying hypovolaemia
- Respiratory rate?
	- Shallow, rapid breathing consider generalised abdominal pain, peritonitis or subdiaphragmatic irritation
	- Sustained tachypnoea is associated with sepsis, metabolic acidosis, anaemia, pneumonia and CCF
- Temperature?
	- Fever consider infection or inflammation
# Selective History and Chart Review
- Onset gradual or sudden?
	- Sudden onset => Perforation of a viscus, ruptured ectopic pregnancy, torsion of an ovarian cyst or a leaking AAA
	- Severe pain in waves that develops over minutes to hours => colic (renal, biliary or intestinal)
- Character?
