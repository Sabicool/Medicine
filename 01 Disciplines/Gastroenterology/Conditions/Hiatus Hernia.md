# Definitions
- _Sliding_ hiatus hernias are the most common type of hiatus hernias
- A type _I_ hiatal hernia is a _sliding_ hiatal hernia
- A type _II_ hiatal hernia is a _paraoesophageal_ hiatal hernia
- A type _III_ hiatal hernia is a _mixed_ hiatal hernia
- A type _IV_ hiatal hernia is a _complex_ hiatal hernia
# Risk Factors
- Age -> phrenooesophageal ligament weakens
- Obesity -> deposition of fat in and around the crura → widened hiatus
- Smoking -> loss of elastin fibres in the diaphragmatic crura
- Prolonged periods of increased intra-abdominal pressure for example from:
	- Pregnancy
	- Ascites
	- Chronic cough
	- Chronic constipation
# Clinical Features
- Most hiatal hernias are asymptomatic and require no medical or surgica intervention
- Type 1 hiatus hernia patients have symptoms similar to _Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GORD)_ 
- The _saint_ triad is a common triad of pathologies consisting of _cholelithiasis, diverticulosis, and hiatal hernia_
# Investigations and diagnosis
- Barium swallow
- Endoscopy
- Often incidentally found on chest X-ray
# Management
- Non-pharmacological
	- Same as [[Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease|GORD]]
- Pharmacological
	- PPIs
- Surgery
	- Laparoscopic/open fundoplication and hiatoplasty
		- Indicated when:
			- Persistence of symptoms despite conservative management
			- Refusal or inability to take long-term PPIs
			- Severe symptoms/complications of gastroesophageal reflux disease: bleeding, strictures, ulcerations
# Complications
- Type I has similar complications to [[Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease|GORD]]
- Complications of II, III, IV:
	- Upper GI bleeding → iron deficiency anaemia
	- Gastric ulcers
	- Gastric perforation
	- Gastric volvulus
	  - Total gastric obstruction
	    - Total gastric obstruction is characterised by _Borchadt_ triad which is _severe epigastric pain, unproductive retching and inability to pass a NG tube_
