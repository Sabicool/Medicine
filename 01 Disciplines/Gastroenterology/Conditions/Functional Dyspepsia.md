- Functional heartburn = is defined as the presence of heartburn (retrosternal burning or pain) that is unrelated to oesophageal acid exposure and is not caused by gastro-oesophageal reflux.
- Functional dyspepsia = is characterised by predominant epigastric pain or burning (epigastric pain syndrome), or early satiety or discomfort after meals (postprandial distress syndrome).  
- To diagnose *functional heartburn* or *functional dyspepsia*, symptoms must have been present for _6 months_ and investigated appropriately to exclude structural and metabolic causes
