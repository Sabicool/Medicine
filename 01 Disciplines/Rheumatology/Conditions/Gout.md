# Presentation
- First attack can mimic septic arthritis
	- Fever, malaise, leucocytosis and elevated inflammatory markers
- In females, the first attack may be polyarticular, typically in the hands with gouty tophi
- Incidence of gout increases with age, in females rarely occurs before menopause
- Clinical features:
	- Monoarticular involvement of the foot or ankle (especially the first metatarsophalangeal MTP joint)
	- Previous similar acute arthritis episodes
	- Rapid onset of severe pain and swelling (reaching a peak in the intensity of pain and swelling within 24 hours)
	- Erythema
	- Tophi
	- Strong family history of gout
	- Cardiovascular disease and hyperuricaemia in males or postmenopausal females.
# Risk Factors
- Those with comorbidities including hypertension, chronic kidney disease, dyslipidaemia, type 2 diabetes and obesity
- Those in a catabolic state (e.g. sepsis) or are dehydrated are at an increased risk of developing an acute attack
	- Often occurs during or immediately following hospitalisation
- Strong family history of gout
- Medications that inhibit renal excretion of uric acid (e.g. thiazide diuretics, loop diuretics (see [[Diuretics]]), ciclosporin)
- Consumption of purine-rich foods, alcohol or fructose-sweetened drinks
- Disorders involving high cell turnover (e.g. haematological malignancies, severe psoriasis)
- Obesity, hypertension, chronic kidney disease, dyslipiedaemia, type-2 diabetes
# Diagnosis/Investigations
- Aspiration of an affected joint or bursa is the gold standard for confirming a diagnosis of gout
- Typically occurs when serum uric acid > 0.42 mmol/L (7 mg/dL)
# Management
- Ideally diagnosis by aspiration should be made prior to starting urate lowering therapy
	- Improvement with colchicine can also happen in pseudogout
- Overview of management
	- Analgesia for acute gout
	- Discuss lifelong urate-lowering therapy and start using a treat-to-target approach
	- Modify existing medications thought to be contributing
