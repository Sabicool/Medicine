# Presentation
- First attack can mimic septic arthritis
	- Fever, malaise, leucocytosis and elevated inflammatory markers
- In females, the first attack may be polyarticular, typically in the hands with gouty tophi
- Incidence of gout increases with age, in females rarely occurs before menopause
- Clinical features:
	- Monoarticular involvement of the foot or ankle (especially the first metatarsophalangeal MTP joint)
	- Previous similar acute arthritis episodes
	- Rapid onset of severe pain and swelling (reaching a peak in the intensity of pain and swelling within 24 hours)
	- Erythema
	- Tophi
	- Strong family history of gout
	- Cardiovascular disease and hyperuricaemia in males or postmenopausal females.
# Risk Factors
- Those with comorbidities including hypertension, chronic kidney disease, dyslipidaemia, type 2 diabetes and obesity
- Those in a catabolic state (e.g. sepsis) or are dehydrated are at an increased risk of developing an acute attack
	- Often occurs during or immediately following hospitalisation
- Strong family history of gout
- Medications that inhibit renal excretion of uric acid (e.g. thiazide diuretics, loop diuretics (see [[Diuretics]]), ciclosporin)
- Consumption of purine-rich foods, alcohol or fructose-sweetened drinks
- Disorders involving high cell turnover (e.g. haematological malignancies, severe psoriasis)
# Diagnosis/Investigations
- Aspiration of an affected joint or bursa is the gold standard for confirming a diagnosis of gout
- Measure serum uric acid concentration
	- Typically occurs when serum uric acid > 0.42 mmol/L (7 mg/dL)
- Measure kidney function
- Clinical diagnosis is supported by:
	- Monoarticular involvement of the foot or ankle or MTP joint
	- Previous similar acute arthritis episodes
	- Rapid onset of severe pain and swelling (reaching a peak in the intensity of pain and swelling within 24 hours)
	- Erythema, tophi
	- Strong family history of gout
	- Cardiovascular disease and hyperuricaemia in males or postmenopausal females
- A plain X-ray of the joint is useful to identify joint damage due to gout and its presence is an indication for urate-lowering therapy
# Management
- Ideally diagnosis by aspiration should be made prior to starting urate lowering therapy
	- Improvement with colchicine can also happen in pseudogout
- Overview of management
	- Analgesia for acute gout
	- Discuss lifelong urate-lowering therapy and start using a treat-to-target approach
	- Modify existing medications thought to be contributing
## Acute Gout
- It is safe to start or modify urate-lowering therapy during treatment of an acute attack
- Corticosteroids local or oral have a lower incidence of adverse effects than oral NSAID therapy
	- Prednisolone (or prednisone) 15-30 mg orally daily until symptoms subside typically 3-5 days
- Oral NSAIDs
	- Celecoxib 100-200 mg orally daily in 1 or 2 divided doses until symptoms subside
	- Ibuprofen immediate-release 200 to 400 mg orally, 3 or 4 times daily until symptoms subside
	- Naproxen immediate-release 250 to 500 mg orally, twice daily until symptoms subside
	- Naproxen modified-release 750 to 1000 mg orally, daily until symptoms subside
- Oral colchicine has a small therapeutic window with risk of toxicity and adverse effects at higher doses; unlikely to be effective if not started within 24 hours of an attack
	- Colchicine 1mg orally initially, then 0.5 mg 1 hour later, as a single one-day course 
	- Often used together with an NSAID (above) for symptom relief until the flare resolves
	- Avoid in patients with kidney impairment
## Chronic Gout
- Target serum uric acid concentrations
	- Nontophaceous gout: <0.36 mmol/L (6 mg/dL)
	- Tophaceous gout, chronic arthroplasty or frequent attacks: <0.30 mmol/L (5mg/dL) initially until total crystal dissolution and resolution of gout then <0.36 mmol/L (6 mg/dL)
- Allopurinol 500 mg orally daily then increase the dose by 50 mg every 2 weeks or by 100 mg every 4 weeks up to a maximum daily dose of 900 mg to achieve the target serum uric acid concentration (above)
	- Avoid combination of allopurinol with either azathioprine or mercaptopurine
	- Skin rash is the most common side effect of allopurinol
- Starting or increasing urate-lowering therapy is associated with a high risk of gout flare, so flare prophylaxis is recommended with colchicine 500 mcg daily for at least 6 months; reduce dosage in kidney impairment or in people who experience diarrhoea
- Consider adding if not reaching target serum uric acid concentration despite allopurinol adherence:
	- Probenecid 250 mg orally twice daily for 1 week then increasing to 500 mg twice daily; then increase the daily dose by 500 mg every 4 weeks to achieve the target serum uric acid concentration (maximum 2 g daily in divided doses)
- If allopurinol not tolerated use:
	- Febuxostat 40 mg orally daily for 2 to 4 weeks; then increase the daily dose by 40 mg every 2 to 4 weeks to achieve the target sesrum uric acid concentration. Maximum daily dose 120 mg
