- General principle is that they increase the rate of reactions by causing optimal conditions to occur (i.e. are catalysts; biological catalysts per se)
- Main features of enzymes are: catalysis, specificity (complex three-dimensional structure resulting in highly specific binding site), regulation (the rate of a biochemical pathway is often controlled by regulating the activity of enzymes along the path)

> [!NOTE] Le Chatelier’s principle
> If a chemical equilibrium experiences a change in concentration or partial pressure, the equilibrium shifts to counteract this change and a new equilibrium is reached
- Types of Enzymes
	- Oxidoreductases, which catalyse oxidation and reduction (redox) reactions
	- Transferases, which transfer functional groups (e.g. a kinase transfers a phosphate group) from one molecule to another
	- Hydrolases, which catalyse hydrolysis reactions
	- Lyases, which cleave bonds by means other than hydrolysis and oxidation
	- Isomerases, which allow a molecule to interconvert between its isomers
	- Ligases, which use energy (derived from ATP hydrolysis) to join two molecules together with covalent bonds
- Cofactor: non-protein molecules that are required by enzymes (e.g. cytochrome P450 group of enzymes all contain $\ce{Fe^{2+}}$)
- Coenzyme: organic molecules required by enzymes (e.g. Coenzyme A is used by acetyl-CoA carboxylase to transfer acyl groups)
# Clinical Relevance
- Cytochrome P450 metabolises most anaesthetic drugs (notable exceptions being atracurium and cistracurium, catecholamines, suxamethonium, mivacurium and remifentanyl)
- Monoamine oxidase metabolises monoamine catecholamines (e.g. adrenaline, dopamine, noradrenaline)
	- Indirect-acting sympathomimetics may precipitate a potentially fatal hypertensive crisis when patients are taking MAO inhibitors. Where necessary, direct acting sympathomimetics (e.g. isoprenaline) can be used at a reduced dose, as they are also metabolised by another enzyme, catechol-O-methyl transferase (COMT)
- Pseudocholinesterase (plasma cholinesterase or butyrylcholinesterase) metabolises suxamethonium and mivacurium
	- Patients who lack this enzyme can develop suxamethonium apnoea
- Acetylcholinesterases hydrolyse the neutotransmitted acetylcholine terminating neurotransmission
	- Neostigmine is a reversible AChE inhibitor which increases concentration of ACh in the synaptic cleft and competitively displaces non-depolarising muscle relaxants from their receptors
- Non specific tissue and plasma esterases rapidly hydrolyse ramifentanyl and esmolol (hence why esmolol is able to be used as an infusion)
