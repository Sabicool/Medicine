- Organelles
	- Mitochondria
		- Outer mitochondrial membrane
		- Intermembrane space where $\ce{H+}$ ions are pumped into which is used to synthesise ATP
		- Inner mitochondrial membrane where the electron transport chain occurs
		- Inner mitochondrial matrix where other metabolic processes take place (e.g. citric acid cycle, fatty acid metabolism and the urea cycle)
	- Endoplasmic reticulum
		- Rough ER more prominent in protein producing cells (e.g. antibody-producing plasma cells)
		- Smooth ER is for steroid and lipid synthesis; therefore more prominent in cells of the adrenal cortex for example
			- In smooth muscles it is known as the sarcoplasmic reticulum and serves as a intracellular store of $\ce{Ca^{2+}}$ hat releases $\ce{Ca^{2+}}$ following depolarisation
	- Golgi apparatus
		- For modification and packaging of proteins in preparation for secretion
		- When the Golgi apparatus receives a protein from the ER, it is modified through the addition of carbohydrate or phosphate groups, processes known as glycosylation and phosphorylation
	- Lysosomes
		- Found in all cells, but are particularly common in phagocytic cell
		- Contain digestive enzymes, acid and free radical species and they play a role in cell housekeeping (degrading old, malfunctioning or obsolete proteins), programmed cell death (apoptosis) and the destruction of phagocytosed microorganisms
