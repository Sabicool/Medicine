- Organelles
	- Mitochondria
		- Outer mitochondrial membrane
		- Intermembrane space where $\ce{H+}$ ions are pumped into which is used to synthesise ATP
		- Inner mitochondrial membrane where the electron transport chain occurs
		- Inner mitochondrial matrix where other metabolic processes take place (e.g. citric acid cycle, fatty acid metabolism and the urea cycle)
	- Endoplasmic reticulum
		- Rough ER more prominent in protein producing cells (e.g. antibody-producing plasma cells)
