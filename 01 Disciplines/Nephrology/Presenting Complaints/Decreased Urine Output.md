# Phone Call/Presentation Questions
- What is the urine output? (How much urine has been passed in the past 24 hours)
	- Oliguria = urine output <400mL/day (<20mL/h)
	- Anuria ⇒ mechanical obstruction of bladder outlet, blocked IDC or obstructed single kidney
	- How are we measuring this and why?
	- How much does the patient weigh?
- Does the patient have abdominal pain?
	- Generalised abdominal pain ⇒ ? acutely distended bladder with urinary retention
- Is the patient eating and drinking?
- Other observations?
- Does the patient have an indwelling urinary catheter?
- Reason for admission?
- Does the patient have an IVC?
## Instructions
- If IDC in place and the patient is anuric ask the nurse to flush the catheter with 20-30mL of normal saline
- Request blood for FBC, UEC and creatinine
	- Serum potassium of >5.5mmol/L ⇒ [[Hyperkalaemia]]
## Prioritisation
- Urgently assess patient with painful urinary retention with urine output <20mL/h or daily urine output of <400mL
	- Can be a sign of AKI which can cause hyperkalaemia and fluid overload
- Otherwise can wait for high-priority problems, provided patient is not in pain and serum potassium is not elevated
# Common Causes *(Corridor thoughts)*
- Normal urine output in a healthy individual should be between 0.5-1.5 mL/kg/hour, and patients should generally be urinating at least every 6 hours ([Geeky Medics: Measuring & Recording Urine Output](https://geekymedics.com/measuring-recording-urine-output/#:~:text=Calculating%20the%20rate%20of%20urine%20output&text=Normal%20urine%20output%20in%20a,at%20least%20every%206%20hours.)).
- Pre-renal
	- Absolute decrease in circulating blood volume causing hypoperfusion:
		- Inadequate fluid intake e.g. after surgery
		- Increased loss of blood or fluids (haemorrhage, burns, erythroderma, hypertheymia, GI fluid losses such as vomiting, diarrhoea, NG suction, renal losses such as diuretics and glycosuria)
		- Third spacing of fluid e.g. in pancreatitis, bowel obstruction
	- Cardiac failure 
		- MI (cardiogenic shock), CCF
	- Effective decrease in blood volume (vasodilation)
		- Sepsis, anaphylaxis, neurogenic [[Shock]]
		- Vasodilatory drugs, anaesthetic drugs
	- Obstruction to circulation
		- Constrictive pericarditis, cardiac tamponade, PE
	- Locally reduced renal perfusion
		- Renal artery or renal vein occlusion (2° thrombosis or stenosis)
		- Noradrenaline, adrenaline
		- NSAIDs, ACE-i
- Intra-renal
	- Acute tubular necrosis
		- Usually 2° to pre-renal causes
		- Medications (e.g. aminoglycosides, amphotericin B, IV contrast, chemotherapy)
		- Poisons (e.g. ethylene glycol, mercury, carbon tetrachloride)
		- Endogenous substances (e.g. myoglobin, Bence-Jones protein, amyloid)
	- Glomerulonephritis
	- Interstitial nephritis
		- Pyelonephritis
		- Medications (e.g. NSAIDs, penicillins, cephalosporins, sulfonamides, ciprofloxacin, rifampicin)
		- Malignancy (e.g. lymphoma or leukaemia)
		- Systemic disorder (SLE, sarcoidosis, hypercalcaemia)
- Post-renal
	- Upper renal tract obstruction
		- Stone, blood clot, sloughed papilla (single kidney)
		- Retroperitoneal fibrosis, retroperitoneal tumour
	- Lower urinary tract obstruction (bladder outlet obstruction)
		- Prostatic hypertrophy, carcinoma of the cervix
		- Stone, blood clot, urethral stricture
	- Catheter blockage

> [!WARNING]
> - A reduced urine output may be the earliest manifestation of shock; restoration of urine output >0.5mL/kg/h signifies restoration of adequate renal perfusion
> - Oliguric acute renal failure may be associated with hyperkalaemia, hypertension or acute pulmonary oedema
> - Sequelae of acute renal failure include:
> 	- Hyperkalaemia
> 	- Metabolic acidosis 
> 	- Acute hypertension (see [[Hypertension#Immediate Management|Hypertension]])
> 	- Pulmonary oedema secondary to salt and water retention
