# Phone Call/Presentation Questions
- What is the urine output? (How much urine has been passed in the past 24 hours)
	- Oliguria = urine output <400mL/day (<20mL/h)
	- Anuria ⇒ mechanical obstruction of bladder outlet, blocked IDC or obstructed single kidney
	- How are we measuring this and why?
	- How much does the patient weigh?
- Does the patient have abdominal pain?
	- Generalised abdominal pain ⇒ ? acutely distended bladder with urinary retention
- Is the patient eating and drinking?
- Other observations?
- Does the patient have an indwelling urinary catheter?
- Reason for admission?
- Does the patient have an IVC?
## Instructions
- If IDC in place and the patient is anuric ask the nurse to flush the catheter with 20-30mL of normal saline
- Request blood for FBC, UEC and creatinine
	- Serum potassium of >5.5mmol/L ⇒ [[Hyperkalaemia]]
## Prioritisation
- Urgently assess patient with painful urinary retention with urine output <20mL/h or daily urine output of <400mL
	- Can be a sign of AKI which can cause hyperkalaemia and fluid overload
- Otherwise can wait for high-priority problems, provided patient is not in pain and serum potassium is not elevated
# Common Causes *(Corridor thoughts)*
- Normal urine output in a healthy individual should be between 0.5-1.5 mL/kg/hour, and patients should generally be urinating at least every 6 hours ([Geeky Medics: Measuring & Recording Urine Output](https://geekymedics.com/measuring-recording-urine-output/#:~:text=Calculating%20the%20rate%20of%20urine%20output&text=Normal%20urine%20output%20in%20a,at%20least%20every%206%20hours.)).
- Dehydration
- Catheter blockage
- Sepsis
- AKI
