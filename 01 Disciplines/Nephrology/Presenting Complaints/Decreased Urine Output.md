# Phone Call/Presentation Questions
- What is the urine output? (How much urine has been passed in the past 24 hours)
	- Oliguria = urine output <400mL/day (<20mL/h)
	- Anuria ⇒ mechanical obstruction of bladder outlet, blocked IDC or obstructed single kidney
	- How are we measuring this and why?
	- How much does the patient weigh?
- Does the patient have abdominal pain?
	- Generalised abdominal pain ⇒ ? acutely distended bladder with urinary retention
- Is the patient eating and drinking?
- Other observations?
- Does the patient have an indwelling urinary catheter?
- Reason for admission?
- Does the patient have an IVC?
## Instructions
- If IDC in place and the patient is anuric ask the nurse to flush the catheter with 20-30mL of normal saline
- Request blood for FBC, UEC and creatinine
	- Serum potassium of >5.5mmol/L ⇒ [[Hyperkalaemia]]
## Prioritisation
- Urgently assess patient with painful urinary retention with urine output <20mL/h or daily urine output of <400mL
	- Can be a sign of AKI which can cause hyperkalaemia and fluid overload
- Otherwise can wait for high-priority problems, provided patient is not in pain and serum potassium is not elevated
# Common Causes *(Corridor thoughts)*
- Normal urine output in a healthy individual should be between 0.5-1.5 mL/kg/hour, and patients should generally be urinating at least every 6 hours ([Geeky Medics: Measuring & Recording Urine Output](https://geekymedics.com/measuring-recording-urine-output/#:~:text=Calculating%20the%20rate%20of%20urine%20output&text=Normal%20urine%20output%20in%20a,at%20least%20every%206%20hours.)).
- Pre-renal
	- Absolute decrease in circulating blood volume causing hypoperfusion:
		- Inadequate fluid intake e.g. after surgery
		- Increased loss of blood or fluids (haemorrhage, burns, erythroderma, hypertheymia, GI fluid losses such as vomiting, diarrhoea, NG suction, renal losses such as diuretics and glycosuria)
		- Third spacing of fluid e.g. in pancreatitis, bowel obstruction
	- Cardiac failure 
		- MI (cardiogenic shock), CCF
	- Effective decrease in blood volume (vasodilation)
		- Sepsis, anaphylaxis, neurogenic [[Shock]]
		- Vasodilatory drugs, anaesthetic drugs
	- Obstruction to circulation
		- Constrictive pericarditis, cardiac tamponade, PE
	- Locally reduced renal perfusion
		- Renal artery or renal vein occlusion (2° thrombosis or stenosis)
		- Noradrenaline, adrenaline
		- NSAIDs, ACE-i
- Intra-renal
	- Acute tubular necrosis
		- Usually 2° to pre-renal causes
		- Medications (e.g. aminoglycosides, amphotericin B, IV contrast, chemotherapy)
		- Poisons (e.g. ethylene glycol, mercury, carbon tetrachloride)
		- Endogenous substances (e.g. myoglobin, Bence-Jones protein, amyloid)
	- Glomerulonephritis
	- Interstitial nephritis
		- Pyelonephritis
		- Medications (e.g. NSAIDs, penicillins, cephalosporins, sulfonamides, ciprofloxacin, rifampicin)
		- Malignancy (e.g. lymphoma or leukaemia)
		- Systemic disorder (SLE, sarcoidosis, hypercalcaemia)
- Post-renal
	- Upper renal tract obstruction
		- Stone, blood clot, sloughed papilla (single kidney)
		- Retroperitoneal fibrosis, retroperitoneal tumour
	- Lower urinary tract obstruction (bladder outlet obstruction)
		- Prostatic hypertrophy, carcinoma of the cervix
		- Stone, blood clot, urethral stricture
	- Catheter blockage

> [!WARNING]
> - A reduced urine output may be the earliest manifestation of shock; restoration of urine output >0.5mL/kg/h signifies restoration of adequate renal perfusion
> - Oliguric acute renal failure may be associated with hyperkalaemia, hypertension or acute pulmonary oedema
> - Sequelae of acute renal failure include:
> 	- Hyperkalaemia
> 	- Metabolic acidosis 
> 	- Acute hypertension (see [[Hypertension#Immediate Management|Hypertension]])
> 	- Pulmonary oedema secondary to salt and water retention

# Assessment
## End of Bed
- How does the patient look?
    - A restless patient with abdominal discomfort, agitation and a sensation of needing to pass urine suggests an acutely distended bladder
    - Sometimes urinary retention and/or ↓ urine output can have no obvious problems
## A → E Assessment
- Heart rate and blood pressure?
    - ↑HR by >20 beats/min + ↓SBP by >20mmHg or any ↓DBP ⇒ significant hypovolaemia → pre-renal hypoperfusion
    - However ↑HR alone may be due to ↓ intravascular volume, pain of distended bladder or infection
    - Acute hypertenstion with oedema may result from acute glomerulonephritis
- Temperature?
    - Fever suggests sepsis which could be 2° to UTI, pyelonephritis or systemic bacteraemia
## Selective History and Chart Review
- Review patient's history and hospital course looking for factors that predispose to pre-renal, renal or post-renal causes of decreased urine ouptput with ANKI
- Review observations and fluid balance chart for fluctuations in fluid intake, urine output and body weight
- Medication chart:
    - Nephrotoxic drugs, especially in combination such as ACE-i with diuretic and NSAID; aminoglycoside with amphoterecin B; IV contrast material with an ACE-i; or a patient in CCF given an NSAID
    - Dose the onset coincide with the commencement of the nephrotoxic drug?
    - Potassium supplements worsen hyperkalaemia
- Recent blood urea and creatinine values
    - Urea-to-creatinine ratio >20 with specific gravity of >1.020 or urine sodium concentration of <20mmol/L suggests a pre-renal cause
    - Urea-to-creatinine ratio <10 with urine specific gravity of <1.020 or urine sodium concentration of >20mmol/L suggests a intrinsic renal cause (e.g. ATN)

# Investigations
- Take bloods for FBC, UEC and blood glucose
	- UEC: look for hyperkalaemia
	- FBC: Normal Hb suggests acute renal impairment whereas ↓ Hb suggests chronic renal impairment
- LFTs, autoantibodies accordingly as suspected
- VBG for raised anion gap metabolic acidosis from uraemia
- Perform ECG
	- Look for signs of hyperkalaemia: peaked T waves, depressed ST segments, prolonged PR interval, loos of P waves and wide QRS complexes
	- Look for evidence of MI or the widespread concave elevation of pericarditis
- Bedside bladder scan to measure residual bladder volume in obstruction
- Collect urine for dipstick analysis and send to laboratory for MCS including cells and casts, plus urinary electrolyte testing
	- Specific gravity
		- SG >1.025: highly concentrated urine associated with dehydration and pre-renal failure
		- SG 1.010: may be associated with chronic renal disease
		- SG <1.005: inability to concentrate urine (ATN, pyelonephritis)
	- Haematuria (stone disease, pyelonephritis, GN with >70% dysmorphic RBC)
	- Proteinuria (nephrotic syndrome, GN, pyelonephritis, CCF, myeloma)
	- Leucocytes and nitrites (UTI, pyelonephritis)
	- Urine microscopy
		- Leucocytes, Gram-stained organisms, erythrocytes, epithelial cells
		- RBC casts are diagnostic of GN
		- WBC casts (especially eosinophil casts) are seen in acute interstitial nephritis
		- Pigmented granular casts are seen with ATN
		- Oval fat bodies are suggestive of nephrotic syndrome
# Immediate Management
- Commence oxygen therapy to maintain saturation >94%
- Attach continuous non-invasive ECG, BP and pulse oximeter monitoring to the patient
- Insert an IDC to accurately monitor fluid balance
- Lower urinary tract obstruction by insertion of an IDC
	- If there has been bladder outlet obstruction, the initial urine volume on catheterisation is usually >400 mL and the patient experiences immediate relief
	- After catheterisation for urinary retention, watch for a post-obstructive diuresis by measuring urine volumes hourly
 - Flush a blocked IDC with 20-30mL sterile normal saline to resolve intraluminal blockage causing anuria
## Life Threatening Complications
- Severe hyperkalaemia:
	- Give 10% calcium chloride 10mL IV over 2-3 minutes to provide immediate cardioprotection to prevent cardiac arrest
	- Reduce serum potassium level:
		- Give 50mL of 50% dextrose IV with 10 units of soluble insulin over 20 minutes
		- Give salbutamol 5-10mg nebulised or 200-500mcg salbutamol IV slowly; repeat doses may be given
		- Give 8.4% sodium bicarbonate ($\ce{NaHCO3-}$) 50mL IV over 5 minutes if the patient is acidotic, provided there is no volume overload; works best in combination with dextrose/insulin therapy and salbutamol
		- Follow up with potassium exchange resin: calcium resonium 30g PO or enema
- Hypotension with intravascular depletion
	- Restore the intravascular volume with normal saline in pre-renal failure; give IV fluid bolus 20mL/kg normal saline repeatedly as needed
	- Observe the effect of this fluid challenge on the pulse, JVP, BP and urine output aiming to optimise renal perfusion by reversing hypovolaemia
- Acute pulmonary oedema
	- See [[Acute Pulmonary Oedema#Management|APO]]
	- In addition to upright, oxygen, gtn, frusemide:
		- Give frusemide if pre-renal perfusion is normal
		- Consider CPAP and/or IV GTN after consultation with senior doctor
		- Monitor diuresis with hourly urine measures and frequent checks of vital signs
		- Arrange urgent dialysis if the patient remains volume overloaded, severely acidotic and/or hyperkalaemic
# Specific Management
- Identify cause and cease all inappropriate medications (Potassium supplements and potassium-sparing diuretics, NSAIDs, ACE inhibitors)
	- Leave a note to inform the usual medical team if on call
- Reduce the dose of renally excreted medications that cannot be stopped immediately (e.g. aminoglycosides)
- Consider indications for dialysis; consult senior and call ICU:
	- Hyperkalaemia (>6.5mmol/L) refractory to conventional therapy
	- Severe and symptomatic metabolic acidosis (pH <7.1)
	- Fluid overload unresponsive to diuretics
	- Uraemic encephalopathy with symptoms of decreased mental status, obtundation and seizures or uraemic pericarditis
