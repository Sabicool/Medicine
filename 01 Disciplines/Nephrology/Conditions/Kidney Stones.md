# Pathophysiology
- Calcium oxalate +/- calcium phosphate: ~75%
- Struvite (triple phosphate): 15% → mostly in the setting of infection with urease producing bacteria (e.g. Proteus, Klebsiella, Pseudomonas and Enterobacter)
- Pure calcium phosphate: 5-7%
- Uric acid: 5-8%
- Cystine: 1%
- Lithogenic medications: 1%
# Presentation
- Most patients present between 30-60 years of age
- Risk factors
	- Low fluid intake
    - Urinary tract malformations (horseshoe kidney, duplex collecting system)
	- Urinary tract infections (especially urease producing bacteria)
	- Cystinuria
	- Hypercalciuria (high sodium intake, [[Hypercalcaemia|primary hyperparathyroidism]], hypervitaminosis D, [[Cushing syndrome]], [[Sarcoidosis]], Milk-alkali syndrom)
	- Hyperuricosuria ([[Gout]])
# Clinical Features
- Haematuria may be absent in approximately 15% of patients
- Strangury is also present occasionally
- Some patients may have complications of obstructive pyelonephritis and therefore may have a septic clinical presentation
- Children may describe vague abdominal pain
