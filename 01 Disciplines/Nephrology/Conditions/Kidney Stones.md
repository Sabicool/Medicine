# Pathophysiology
- Calcium oxalate +/- calcium phosphate: ~75%
- Struvite (triple phosphate): 15% → mostly in the setting of infection with urease producing bacteria (e.g. Proteus, Klebsiella, Pseudomonas and Enterobacter)
- Pure calcium phosphate: 5-7%
- Uric acid: 5-8%
- Cystine: 1%
- Lithogenic medications: 1%
# Presentation
- Most patients present between 30-60 years of age
- Risk factors
	- Low fluid intake
    - Urinary tract malformations (horseshoe kidney, duplex collecting system)
	- Urinary tract infections (especially urease producing bacteria)
	- Cystinuria
	- Hypercalciuria (high sodium intake, [[Hypercalcaemia|primary hyperparathyroidism]], hypervitaminosis D, [[Cushing syndrome]], [[Sarcoidosis]], Milk-alkali syndrom)
	- Hyperuricosuria ([[Gout]])
# Clinical Features
- Haematuria may be absent in approximately 15% of patients
- Strangury is also present occasionally
- Some patients may have complications of obstructive pyelonephritis and therefore may have a septic clinical presentation
- Children may describe vague abdominal pain
# Radiographic Features
# Management
- Approximately 90% of stones <4 mm are likely to pass down the ureter and into the bladder, and thus often require no more than analgesia and hydration
- Indications for surgical management include:
	- Larger stones, typically those above 5 mm in size
	- Extended duration of symptoms
     - Location of the stone, with proximal calculi less likely to spontaneously pass
	- Infection or septic features
	- Certain professions (airline pilot, truck driver) due to the risk of renal colic during work
	- Solitary kidney
	- Failed conservative management
- Surgical
	- Typically retrograde ureteric stent with subsequent laser lithotripsy
	- If acutely septic and not fir for anaesthetic percutaneous nephrostomy with an antegrade stent followed by laser lithotripsy is preferred
	- Extracorporeal shock wave lithoripsy is preferred for large proximal calculi in patients unsuitable for invasive management
	- Percutaneous nephrolithotomy for large calculi near the pelviureteric junction (especially staghorn calculi)
