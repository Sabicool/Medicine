- Stress and anxiety can exacerbate the perception of pain. Strategies that may be helpful to minimise stress and anxiety include:
	- Parental presence and comforting touch when possible
	- Use distraction therapy eg video, music, toys, blowing bubbles, storytelling by the child, counting
	- Engage child life therapist (play therapy) if available
	- Swaddling, feeding, skin to skin care and dummy use for infants
	- Breathing techniques
	- Tactile stimulation: touching the skin near the site using rhythmic rubbing, manual pressure, ‘Buzzy bee’
- In the case of injuries, useful strategies include:
	- Immediate immobilisation of potential fractures with a splint or backslab
	- Applying ice (if age appropriate) and elevating injured limbs
	- Prompt dressing of burns (see [Burns](https://www.rch.org.au/clinicalguide/guideline_index/Burns/))
	- For limb or finger injuries consider regional local anaesthesia/nerve block

- Prior to venepuncture, cannulation, suprapubic aspirate: Anaesthetic cream e.g. EMLA, AnGel, LMX4
- Nasal/pharyngeal foreign body removal, NGT insertion: Lignocaine: Phenylephrine (CoPhenylcaine Forte) nasal spray
