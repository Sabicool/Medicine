- Always exclude other causes of the [[Febrile child]]
- Peak age prevalence is 6-18 months
- Exposure to cigarette smoke from household contacts is a known modifiable risk factor
# Classification
- Otitis media â‡’ inflammation or infection in the middle ear space
- Otitis media with effusion or serous otitis â‡’ middle ear effusion without infection
- Acute otitis media â‡’ Infection of fluid in the middle ear i.e. OME + infection
	- Therefore acute otitis media is diagnosed on the basis of signs and symptoms of middle ear inflammation: fever, ear, pain distinct erythema of the tympanic membrane + middle ear effusion
- Persistent otitis media with effusion (glue ear) => middle ear effusion present for >3 month without inflammation
- Recurrent acute otitis media => â‰¥3 episodes of AOM within 6 months or â‰¥4 episodes in 12 months
- Chronic suppurative otitis media â‡’ perforated eardrum and discharge >6 weeks
# Aetiology
- Often preceded by a viral URTI
- Explain to parents that the Eustachian tube in children is shorter and more horizontal so infection happens from bacterial pathogens in the nasopharynx going to the ear through the Eustachian tube
- Bacterial pathogens:
	- Steptococcus pneumoniae
	- Haemophilus influenzae (less common due to vaccination)
	- Moraxella catarrhalis
- If purulent consider can be caused by:
	- Staphylococcus aureus or Pseudomonas aeruginosa
# Risk Factors
- Risk factors for recurrent bacterial otitis media:
	- Group child care
	- Allergic rhinitis
	- Adenoid disease
	- Various structural abnormalities e.g. cleft palate, those associated with Down syndrome
	- Exposure to smoke (e.g. cigarette, wood fires)
	- Socioeconomic disadvantage (e.g. crowded housing)
- Ensure the child is up to date with [Streptococcus pneumoniae vaccination](https://immunisationhandbook.health.gov.au/sites/default/files/2024-08/Infographic.%20Pneumococcal%20vaccination%20recommendations%20for%20all%20Australians_Aug24.pdf) (completed by 12 months)
# Epidemiology
- Common: 90% of children have â‰¥1 episode and two thirds have â‰¥1 episode by 6 years old
- Peak incidence is between 6 and 24 months
# Presentation
- Acute onset of fever and ear pain often preceded by URTI symptoms
	- Includes: irritability, restless sleep and crying
- Purulent drainage from the ear may be present with AOM with tympanic membrane perforation or otitis externa
# Examination Findings

# Management
## Acute Otitis Media Management
- Symptomatic management
	- See [[Paediatric Pain Management]]
	- For severe acute ear pain consider
		- Short term use of topical analgesia (e.g. 2% lignocaine or 1-2 drops of benzocaine + phenazone (Auralgen) applied to an **intact** tympanic membrane)
	- [QLD acute otitis media analgesia recommendations](https://www.childrens.health.qld.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0020/170534/aom-flowchart-and-medications.pdf):

- Admission/Referral/High Risk Criteria
	- Patients who should be considered for immediate treatment with antibiotics (see image below)
		- <6 months old
		- Immunocompromised
		- ATSI
		- Only hearing ear
		- Child has cochlear implant â†’ discuss with ENT
		- Possible suppurative complication â†’ discuss with ENT
- Non-pharm
	- Avoid getting water in ear if perforated
- Pharm
	- Antibiotic therapy
		- Most cases of acute otitis media resolve spontaneously and antibiotics are not recommended
			- For every 100 children treated with antibiotics, only five children will be better at 2 to 3 days as a consequence of taking antibiotics
			- ABx therapy can cause harm including diarrhoea, rash and hypersensitivity reactions
		- Refer to [local guidelines for antibitoics](https://www.rch.org.au/clinicalguide/guideline_index/Local_Antimicrobial_Guidelines/)
			- NSW and SA (uses eTG):
				- 1st line â†’ Amoxicillin 15mg/kg up to 500mg PO 8-hourly for 5 days or Amoxicillin 30mg/kg up to g PO 12-hourly for 5 days
				- If H. influenzae or M. catarrhalis suspected â†’ Amoxicillin + clavulanate 22.5+3.2mg/kg up to 875+125mg orally 12 hourly for 5-7 days (older than >2 months old)
				- Chronic otorrhoea â†’ combine PO ABx with ciprofloxacin 0.3% ear drops, 5 drops in affected ear 12 hourly until free of discharge for â‰¥3 days
			- QLD [Paediatric antibiocard](https://www.childrens.health.qld.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0037/176878/Antibiocard.pdf#page=9)
				- Amoxicillin 30mg/kg/dose every 8 hours (max 1g/dose) for 5 days
			- Victoria (see RCH guidelines)
			- WA (uses [ChAMP PCH guidelines](https://pch.health.wa.gov.au/~/media/Files/Hospitals/PCH/General-documents/Health-professionals/ChAMP-Guidelines/Ear-Nose-Throat-and-Dental-Infections.pdf?sc_lang=en))
				- Amoxicillin 15mg/kg/dose 8 hourly (max 1g) for 7 days; increase dose if no response after 4-7 days
				- With perforation â†’ amoxicillin 30mg/kg/dose (max 1g) 8 hourly for 14 days
				- Persistent OME or recurrent AOM â†’ oral amoxicillin 25/kg/dose (max 1g) 12 hourly
				- Chronic suppurative otitis media â†“
					- Clean and dry ear before each ear drop
					- Topical ciprofloxacin 0.3% ear drops; 5 drops in the affected ear 12 hourly until free of discharge for at least 3 days

- Discharge planning, safety netting and follow up
	- Return to your doctor if you experience any of the following:
		- Severe ear pain with a headache
		- An infection and you also have diabetes
		- A worsening infection spreading around the outer ear and or the bone behind the ear
		- Drooping of your face on the side of the ear infection
		- Any other new symptoms affecting the muscle function of your face
	- All children with perforation should be reviewed by a GP to ensure it has healed at around 10 days
	- All children with AOM should be seen by their GP at three months to ensure the effusion has resolved
	- Referral to ENT specialist may be considered for children who meet the following criteria:
		- Effusion or perforation for more than 6 weeks
		- Hearing impairment for more than 6 weeks
		- Premature
		- Indigenous or Torres Strait Islander background
	- Flying recommendations
		- Airlines recommend against flying if the passenger is unable to clear their eustachian tubes
		- Children should be safe to fly two weeks after an adequately treated AOM, however many clinicians recommend waiting only 48 hours
		- These children should be given a nasal decongestant at least 30 minutes prior to take-off and landing and analgesia prior to flying
		- During take-off and landing they can be encouraged to suck, chew or swallow or, if old enough, perform a Valsalva manoeuvre to help equalise pressure
