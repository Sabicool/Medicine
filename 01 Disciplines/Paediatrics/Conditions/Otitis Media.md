- Always exclude other causes of the [[Febrile child]]
- Peak age prevalence is 6-18 months
- Exposure to cigarette smoke from household contacts is a known modifiable risk factor
# Classification
- Otitis media â‡’ inflammation or infection in the middle ear space
- Otitis media with effusion or serous otitis â‡’ middle ear effusion without infection
- Acute otitis media â‡’ Infection of fluid in the middle ear i.e. OME + infection
	- Therefore acute otitis media is diagnosed on the basis of signs and symptoms of middle ear inflammation: fever, ear, pain distinct erythema of the tympanic membrane + middle ear effusion
# Aetiology
- Often preceded by a viral URTI
- Explain to parents that the Eustachian tube in children is shorter and more horizontal so infection happens from bacterial pathogens in the nasopharynx going to the ear through the Eustachian tube
- Bacterial pathogens:
	- Steptococcus pneumoniae
	- Haemophilus influenzae (less common due to vaccination)
	- Moraxella catarrhalis
- If purulent consider can be caused by:
	- Staphylococcus aureus or Pseudomonas aeruginosa
# Epidemiology
- Common: 90% of children have â‰¥1 episode and two thirds have â‰¥1 episode by 6 years old
- Peak incidence is between 6 and 24 months
# Presentation
- Acute onset of fever and ear pain often preceded by URTI symptoms
	- Includes: irritability, restless sleep and crying
- Purulent drainage from the ear may be present with AOM with tympanic membrane perforation or otitis externa
# Examination Findings

# Management
- Symptomatic management
	- See [[Paediatric Pain Management]]
	- For severe acute ear pain consider
		- Short term use of topical analgesia (e.g. 2% lignocaine or 1-2 drops of benzocaine + phenazone (Auralgen) applied to an **intact** tympanic membrane)

- Admission/Referral/High Risk Criteria
	- Patients who should be considered for immediate treatment with antibiotics (see image below)
		- <6 months old
		- Immunocompromised
		- ATSI
		- Only hearing ear
		- Child has cochlear implant â†’ discuss with ENT
		- Possible suppurative complication â†’ discuss with ENT
- Non-pharm
	- Avoid getting water in ear if perforated
- Pharm
	- Antibiotic therapy
		- Most cases of acute otitis media resolve spontaneously and antibiotics are not recommended
			- For every 100 children treated with antibiotics, only five children will be better at 2 to 3 days as a consequence of taking antibiotics
			- ABx therapy can cause harm including diarrhoea, rash and hypersensitivity reactions
		- Refer to [local guidelines for antibitoics](https://www.rch.org.au/clinicalguide/guideline_index/Local_Antimicrobial_Guidelines/)
			- NSW (uses eTG):
				- 1st line â†’ Amoxicillin 15mg/kg up to 500mg PO 8-hourly for 5 days or Amoxicillin 30mg/kg up to g PO 12-hourly for 5 days
				- If H. influenzae or M. catarrhalis suspected â†’ Amoxicillin + clavulanate 22.5+3.2mg/kg up to 875+125mg orally 12 hourly for 5-7 days (older than >2 months old)
				- Chronic otorrhoea â†’ combine PO ABx with ciprofloxacin 0.3% ear drops, 5 drops in affected ear 12 hourly until free of discharge for â‰¥3 days
			- QLD [Paediatric antibiocard](https://www.childrens.health.qld.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0037/176878/Antibiocard.pdf#page=9)
				- Amoxicillin 30mg/kg/dose every 8 hours (max 1g/dose) for 5 days
