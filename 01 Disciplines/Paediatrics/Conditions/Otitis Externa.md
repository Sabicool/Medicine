- Also called 'swimmer's ear'
# Aetiology
- Pseudomans aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus are the most common causes
- Can sometimes be fungal (usually in immunocompromised individuals following prolonged antibiotic use) most commonly Candida or Aspergillus
# Prevalence
- Peak incidence is children aged 7-12 years
- More common in summer months when swimming is more common
# Prevention
- Recurrence be prevented by keeping the external ear canal free of water using earlplugs or a shower or bathing cap during showering and swimming and acetic acid plus isopropyl alcohol ear drops following exposure to water
# Presentation
- Often follows water exposure and maceration of the skin
- Tenderness on manipulation of the tragus or auricle and discharge may be present
	- Might be associated with regional lymphadenitis or cellulitis of the pinna and adjacent skin in serious cases
- The ear canal may be erythematous and dry, or it may have grey or black fungal plaques that resemble fuzzy cotton wool
- It is most commonly moist and oedematous, and the narrowed ear canal is filled with serous or purulent debris
- Cerumen (ear wax) is characteristically absent
- Patient with diabetes or immune compromise are susceptible to otomyocsis and necrotising otitis externa → evaluate more carefully
# Management
- Symptomatic
	- Analgesia (paracetamol or ibuprofen)
- Non-Pharm
	- Keep external ear as dry as possible
		- Soft wax earplugs when showering
		- No swimming
	- Discharge or other debris should be removed from the ear canal by **dry** aural toilet (not syringing with water)
		- Healthcare professional: mechanical suction under direct visualisation, cotton wool on probe
		- Parent or carer: Dry mopping of the ear with the rolled up corner of tissue 6 hourly until dry
- Pharm
	- Ear drops after performing dry aural toilet
	- After ear drops apply gentle presure to the tragus for 30 seconds
	- Bacterial:
		- Dexamethasone+framycetin+gramicidin ear drops, 3 drops instilled into the affected ear, 3 times daily for 7 days (Sofradex®, Otodex®)
		- If perforated tympanic membrane or tympanostomy tube in situ consider non-aminoglycysoide containing ear drops:
			- Ciprofloxacin+hydrocortisone ear drops 3 drops instilled into the affected ear, twice daily for 7 days
	- Fungal
		- Flumetasone+clioquinol 3 drops instilled into the affected ear twice daily for 7 days (Kenacomb otic ®/Otocomb Otic ®)
	- If fever and spread of inflammation to the pinna or folliculitis or immune compromise (including diabetes):
		- Obtain swabs
		- Add oral antibiotics: 
			- Dicloxacillin 500mg 6 hourly for 7-10 days or flucloxacillin 500mg 6 hourly for 7-10 days PO
			- Ciprofloxacin 750mg 12 hourly for 7-10 days PO
## Acute Localised Otitis Externa Management
- Commonly caused by Staphylococcus aureus and associated with a boil or furuncle
- Streptococcus pyogenes causes erysipelas that invovles the pinna and external canal
- Manage with:
	- Dicloxacillin 500mg PO 6 hourly for 5 days or flucloxacillin 500mg PO 6 hourly for 5 days
	- In children consider cefalexin (tastes better): cefalexin 500mg (children: 12.5mg/kg up to 500mg) PO 6 hourly for 5 days
## Necrotising Otitis Externa Management
- Mostly in diabetes, elderly or immunocompromised patients
- Spread of infection to cartilage and bone in the external ear canal and base of skull
- Symptoms include fever, severe persistent pain, visible granulation tissue and progressive cranial neuropathies
- Management
	- Refer urgently to infectious disease and ENT
	- Obtain superficial swabs or samples of tissue and pus for culture and susceptibility
	- Start empirical antibitoics until susceptibility testing results available:
		- Ceftazidime 2g IV 8 hourly or Piperacillin+Tazobactam 4+0.5g IV 6 hourly
