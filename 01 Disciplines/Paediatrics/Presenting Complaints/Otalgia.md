# Common Causes *(Corridor Thoughts)*
- Otological causes (primary)
	- Acute [[Otitis Media]]
	- [[Otitis Media]] with Effusion
	- [[Otitis Externa]]
	- Perforation
    - Foreign body in ear (younger children, pain, hearing loss ± foul-smelling discharge)
    - Cerumen impaction
- Referred pain
	- Dental causes: teething, dental caries
	- Pharyngitis/tonsilitis (always examine ENT)
	- Cervical lymphadenopathy
- Other important
	- Acute mastoiditis
	- Tumours (consider in those with recurrent otitis media, unilateral hearing loss)
	- Can consider other things like ramsay hunt
# Assessment
- A→E Assessment including vitals (temperature)
	- Your main concern here is whether there is any concern for sepsis; consider if the patient is active and playful or floppy and unengaged
	- In Infants, especially <6 months old, the diagnosis of AOM and OME can be inaccurate; consider other causes of the febrile child
# Examinations
- General paediatrics exams
	- Examine skin for any rashes
	- Listen to chest sounds for any signs of respiratory tract involvement
- ENT
	- Oropharynx, teeth, jaw and lymph nodes
	- Inspection of pinna, tragus and external auditory canal and palpation of the tragus
		- Pain with manipulation of the tragus ⇒ [[Otitis Externa]]
	- Examine the mastoid process for swelling, erythema and tenderness ⇒ mastoiditis
	- If able to perform the weber and rinne test: show show conductive hearing loss (2° to effusion)
		- Weber localised to the affected ear
		- Rinne test: air conduction impaired in the affected ear
	- Otoscopy
		- Sit the child on the parent's lap with the head immbolised against the parent's chest
		- Pull posteriorly and look anteriorly and superiorly for the tympanic membrane
		- Assess the tympanic membrane for:
			- Translucency: translucent/opaque/partly opaque
			- Colour: clear/grey/white/amber/red
			- Position: normal/retracted/bulging
			- mobility: normal/decreased or absent
		- Middle ear effusion is suggested by:
			- Obscuring of the bony landmark
			- Air fluid levels or bubbles behind the TM
			- Bulging tympanic membrane
			- Otorrhoea
			- Otitis media with effusion is suggested by:
				- Normal or retracted tympanic membrane, clear or amber in colour
			- Acute otitis media is suggested by:
				- Bulging tympanic membrane, purulent effusion and distinct erythema of the tympanic membrane
			- Note that a red tympanic membrane may occur with fever or crying
				- Also differentiate between distinct erythema of the tympanic membrane itself and increased vascularity with red appearance only in areas of blood vessels

#  Investigations
- None regularly performed
- Imaging:
	- Consider CT head if there is concern for mastoiditis or other intracranial [[Otitis Media#Complications|complications]]
# Management
- Symptomatic management
- Admission/Disposition and Scoring Criteria
	- Only children with complications of acute otitis media such as mastoiditis or other intracranial complications require hospitalisation
	- Dicharge
		- If using wait-and-see approach patients should be instructed to follow up with GP if symptoms do not improve in 48-72 hours or earlier if symptoms worsen or signs or symptoms of complications of AOM
- Referral
- Management (specific)
