# Common Causes *(Corridor Thoughts)*
- Otological causes (primary)
	- [[Otitis Media]] and its subtypes
		- Acute otitis media
		- Otitis media with Effusion
		- Chronic suppurative otitis media
	- [[Otitis Externa]]
	- Perforation
    - Foreign body in ear (younger children, pain, hearing loss ± foul-smelling discharge)
    - Cerumen impaction
- Referred pain
	- Dental causes: teething, dental caries
	- Pharyngitis/tonsilitis (always examine ENT)
	- Cervical lymphadenopathy
- Other important
	- [[Acute Mastoiditis]]
	- Tumours (consider in those with recurrent otitis media, unilateral hearing loss)
	- Can consider other things like ramsay hunt
# Assessment
- A→E Assessment including vitals (temperature)
	- Your main concern here is whether there is any concern for sepsis; consider if the patient is active and playful or floppy and unengaged
	- In Infants, especially <6 months old, the diagnosis of AOM and OME can be inaccurate; consider other causes of the febrile child
# Examinations
- General paediatrics exams
	- Examine skin for any rashes
	- Listen to chest sounds for any signs of respiratory tract involvement
- ENT
	- Oropharynx, teeth, jaw and lymph nodes
	- Inspection of pinna, tragus and external auditory canal and palpation of the tragus
		- Pain with manipulation of the tragus ⇒ [[Otitis Externa]]
	- Examine the mastoid process for swelling, erythema and tenderness ⇒ mastoiditis
	- If able to perform the weber and rinne test: show show conductive hearing loss (2° to effusion)
		- Weber localised to the affected ear
		- Rinne test: air conduction impaired in the affected ear
	- Otoscopy
		- Sit the child on the parent's lap with the head immbolised against the parent's chest
			- ![[Pasted image 20250115153645.png]]
		- Pull posteriorly and look anteriorly and superiorly for the tympanic membrane
		- Assess the tympanic membrane for:
			- Translucency: translucent/opaque/partly opaque
			- Colour: clear/grey/white/amber/red
			- Position: normal/retracted/bulging
			- mobility: normal/decreased or absent
		- Middle ear effusion is suggested by:
			- Obscuring of the bony landmark
			- Air fluid levels or bubbles behind the TM
			- Bulging tympanic membrane
			- Otorrhoea
			- Otitis media with effusion is suggested by:
				- Normal or retracted tympanic membrane, clear or amber in colour
			- Acute otitis media is suggested by:
				- Bulging tympanic membrane, purulent effusion and distinct erythema of the tympanic membrane
			- Note that a red tympanic membrane may occur with fever or crying
				- Also differentiate between distinct erythema of the tympanic membrane itself and increased vascularity with red appearance only in areas of blood vessels
- Other
	- Assess facial nerve function especially in chronic suppurative otitis media

> Patients with an attic perforation (squamous chronic otitis media) or persistent crusting or granulation (above the malleus, in the top part of the TM) should be referred to an ENT surgeon immediately to exclude cholesteatoma

#  Investigations
- None regularly performed
- Imaging:
	- Consider CT head if there is concern for mastoiditis or other intracranial [[Otitis Media#Complications|complications]]
# Management
- Symptomatic management
- Admission/Disposition and Scoring Criteria
	- Only children with complications of acute otitis media such as mastoiditis or other intracranial complications require hospitalisation
	- Dicharge
		- If using wait-and-see approach patients should be instructed to follow up with GP if symptoms do not improve in 48-72 hours or earlier if symptoms worsen or signs or symptoms of complications of AOM
- Referral
- Management (specific)
	- See 
		- [[Otitis Media#Acute Otitis Media Management|AOM Management]]
		- [[Otitis Media#Otitis Media with Effusion Management|OME Management]]
