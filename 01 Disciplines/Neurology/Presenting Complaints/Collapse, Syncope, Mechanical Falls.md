- All of these are characterised by full and rapid neurological recovery
- Syncope is transient loss of consciousness and postural tone from reduced cerebral perfusion, followed by spontaneous and full recovery
- Presyncope refers to a reduction in cerebral perfusion resulting in a sensation of impending loss of consciousness, although the patient does not actually pass out
# Phone Call/Presentation Questions
- Was the collapse witnessed?
- Was the patient lying, sitting or standing when the episode occurred?
	- If while lying down likely cardiac; cannot be postural hypotension
- Did the patient actually lose consciousness?
- Was any seizure like activity observed?
- What are the vital signs now, including GCS score?
- Did the patient sustain any injury?
- What is the blood glucose level?
- What was the reason for admission?
## Instructions Over the Phone
- When no evidence of injury (head, neck or lower limb) and the vital signs are stable:
	- Ask the nurse to slowly raise the patient to a seated position, then standing position
	- Place the patient back into bed to remain there until you arrive
	- Request an ECG and attach non-invasive monitoring to the patient if syncope was the cause of collapse
	- Request a fingerprick BGL
	- Obtain a lying and standing HR and BP; ask the nurse to wait at least 2 minutes after standing the patient up before taking the observations, then repeat the vital signs every 15 minutes until you arrive at the bedside
	- Ask the nurse to call you back immediately if there is deterioration in the level of consciousness or any cardiorespiratory instability
## Prioritisation
- Attend immediately if the patient remains unconscious and/or the HR or BP are abnormal
- If the patient is alert and conscious with normal vital signs, or following an uncomplicated fall with no injury, there is no immediate urgency to attend
# Common Causes *(Corridor Thoughts)*
- Can remember using the mnemonic: HEAD, HEART, VESSELS
    - CNS (head)
        - Hypoxia (hypoglycemia does not cause syncope)
        - Epilepsy (not a true cause of syncope)
        - Anxiety and hyperventilation
        - Dysfunctional brain stem (basivertebral TIA)
    - Cardiac (heart)
        - Heart attack (ACS)
        - Embolism (PE)
        - Aortic obstruction (IHSS, AS or myxoma)
        - Rhythm disturbance, ventricular
        - Tachycardia
    - Vascular (vessels)
        - Vasovagal (emotional reactions) or Valsalva (micturition, cough, straining etc)
        - Ectopic (and other causes of hypovolemia)
        - Situational
        - Subclavian steal
        - ENT (glossopharyngeal neuralgia)
        - Low systemic vascular resistance
            - autononic dysfunction: Addison’s, diabetic vascular neuropathy
            - Drugs such as CCBs, beta-blockers, anti-hypertensives
        - Sensitive carotid sinus
- Otherwise categorise into causes of syncope and causes of mechanical fall:
	- Syncope
		- Cardiac central vascular
			- [[Arrhythmias#Bradyarrhythmias|Bradyarrhythmias]] (Stokes-Adams attack): sinus arrest, second- and third- degree AV block, sick sinus syndrome, pacemaker malfunction
			- [[Arrhythmias#Tachyarrhythmias|Tachyarrhythmias]]: VT, rapid AF or flutter (±WPW), rapid paroxysmal SVT (±WPW), Torsades de pointes (usually with prolonged QT)
			- Obstructive or low-flow conditions: HCM, aortic stenosis, pulmonary embolism
		- Peripheral vascular orthostatic (postural) hypotension
			- Durg induced: Nitrates, hydralazine, prazosin, ACE-i, antipsychotics, levodopa
			- Volume depletion: GI bleed, ruptured AAA, ectopic pregnancy, dehydration
			- Autonomic failure: Diabetes, Parkinson's disease/plus/Lewy body
		- Vasovagal syncope
			- Excessive vagal tone assocaited with standing, emotion, fear, pain, stress, hunger
		- Situational syncope
			- ↑ intrathoracic pressure from coughing, micturition, swallowing, defecation, sneezing
		- Carotid sinus hypersensitivity causes syncope on turning head, tight neck collar etc
		- Cerebrovascular
			- Subarachnoid haemorrhage
			- Vertebrobasillar insufficiency
			- Subclavian artery steal: extremity exercise leads to vertebrobasilar insuffiency
		- Psychogenic
			- Hyperventilation
			- Psychogenic collapse: diagnosis of exclusion only; look for underlying organic basis first
	- Mechanical falls
		- Can be multifactorial especially in older people; combination of environmental hazards, poor vision, diminished muscular strength and impaired proprioception
		- Neurological
			- Dementia resulting in poor safety awareness
			- Confusion and cognitive impairment
			- Pre-existing weakness
			- Parkinson's disease, or other movement disorders including normal pressure hydrocephalus
			- Cerebellar lesions with ataxia
		- Metabolic disorder
			- Electrolyte abnormality such as hyponatraemia, hypokalaemia, hypoglycaemia, hyperglycaemia
			- Dehydration, renal failure (multifactorial), hepatic failure
		- Drugs
			- Narcotics, sedatives, tranquilisers
		- Sensory impairment
			- Cataracts, age-related macular degeneration, glaucoma
			- Impaired balance and proprioception
		- Musculoskeletal
			- Arthritis, obesity and physical inactivity
		- Environmental
			- Wet floor
			- Unsafe clothing or inappropriate footwear
			- Physical
				- Bed rails, IV pole, bed height, edge of a carpet, poor lighting or no handrails
# Assessment
## End of Bed
- Pallor followed by flushing occurs in cardiac syncope, whereas persistent pallor may indicate occult bleeding or another cause of poor peripheral perfusion
- However, most patients who have had a simple mechanical fall or an episode of syncope regain normal consciousness and look perfectly well
## A to E Assessment
- Heart rate?
	- Tachycardia, bradycardia or irregular rhythm may indicate an arrhythmia as the primary cause → perform ECG and attach cardiac monitoring
	- Cardiac cause of collapse have a increased mortality risk
- Blood pressure?
	- A postural fall in BP together with a postural rise in HR (>20 beats/min) suggests intravascular volume depletion
	- A drop in BP without a change in HR, or one that corrects on standing, suggests autonomic dysfunction
	- Hypertension may be associated with SAH or brainstem TIA
# Immediate Management
- Recovery from syncope will be delayed if the patient is kept upright and not placed supine until symptoms resolve
	- Gradually sit the patient up over a few minutes as tolerated
- A cardiac arrhythmia should be confirmed with a 12-lead ECG and treated immediately
- Obtain IV access and give normal saline 10–20 mL/kg IV rapidly if BP <90 mmHg and does not quickly improve with recumbency
- Check for head or neck injury, as spinal immobilisation may be needed
- Move onto selective history and examination if the patient has fully recovered from the syncopal episode, has a normal ECG and normal vital signs
# Selective History and Chart Review
- Previous syncopal episode?
	- Ask if the patient has ever had a previous syncopal episode
	- Ask whether these previous episodes have been documented investigated or diagnosed
- What does the patient (or a witness) recall about the time immediately before the syncope?
	- Try to determine preceding symptoms or obvious precipitant to the collapse
	- Sudden collapse with no warning, syncope lying down, associated palpitations or syncope on exertion suggests a cardiac cause known as a Stokes-Adams attack
	- Syncope on rising from a supine position suggests orthostatic or postural hypotension
	- Emotion or a noxious stimulus such as IV line insertion or painful wound dressing change may cause collapse secondary to a vasovagal episode
	- Preceding nausea, sweating, distant hearing and light-headedness are common with a vasovagal episode
	- Syncope during or immediately after coughing, micturition, straining at stool or sneezing suggests situational syncope
	- Syncope after turning the head to one side (especially if wearing a tight collar) or while shaving may indicate carotid sinus syncope, often in elderly men
	- Syncope occurring during arm exercise suggests subclavian steal syndrome
	- Numbness and tingling in the hands and feet are common just before presyncope or syncope caused by hyperventilation
- Confirm any presenting problem or past medical they may have caused the collapse; examples include:
	- Previous episodes of collapse or falls with or without known diagnosis
	- Evidence of LV failure or a documented reduced LV ejection fraction <30%
	- Known cerebrovascular disease
	- Autonomic neuropathy
	- Positive family history of collapse or sudden death may be due to underlying HCM, WPW syndrome, long QT syndrome or Brugada's syndrome
- Charts
	- Observation charts
		- Check the vital signs to determine whether this is an acute change or if there were long-standing abnormalities in postural BP ⇒ autonomic neuropathy
		- Check the signs of hypovolaemia such as tachycardia, narrowing pulse pressure
		- Check for adequate fluid intake and look at the fluid balance chart
	- Medication charts
		- Nitrates, vasodilator antihypertensives, diuretics, antiarrhythmics, tricyclic antidepressants, antipsychotics, levodopa and sildenafil (Viagra) cause postural hypotension
		- Beta-blockers (including eye drops), calcium-channel blockers, digoxin and amiodarone may cause bradycardia
		- Any CNS depressant increases the risk of falls
		- Quinidine, procainamide, disopyramide, sotalol, amiodarone, tricyclic antidepressants, antipsychotics and some of the ‘non-sedating’ antihistamines prolong the QT interval

# Investigations
- Check a fingerprick glucose for hypo/hyperglycaemia
- ECG in all patients
	- Bradyarrhythmia, tachyarrhythmia, evidence of ACS or previous MI
	- Conduction defects, WPW, prolonged QT, LVH in HCM, or Brugada's syndrome
- Urinary beta-hCG in women of reproductive years
- Other tests as indicated:
	- FBC (bleeding, anaemia)
	- UEC, troponin if AMI is suspected
	- CXR re. cardiomegaly, heart failure
	- Echocardiography, Holter monitoring and exercise testing to investigate for cardiac cause
	- CT if possible neurological cause (e.g. SAH, vertebrobasilar insufficiency) - usually quite rate <2% of syncope
