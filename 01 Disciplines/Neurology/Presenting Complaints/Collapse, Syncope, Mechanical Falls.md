- All of these are characterised by full and rapid neurological recovery
- Syncope is transient loss of consciousness and postural tone from reduced cerebral perfusion, followed by spontaneous and full recovery
- Presyncope refers to a reduction in cerebral perfusion resulting in a sensation of impending loss of consciousness, although the patient does not actually pass out
# Phone Call/Presentation Questions
- Was the collapse witnessed?
- Was the patient lying, sitting or standing when the episode occurred?
	- If while lying down likely cardiac; cannot be postural hypotension
- Did the patient actually lose consciousness?
- Was any seizure like activity observed?
- What are the vital signs now, including GCS score?
- Did the patient sustain any injury?
- What is the blood glucose level?
- What was the reason for admission?
## Instructions Over the Phone
- When no evidence of injury (head, neck or lower limb) and the vital signs are stable:
	- Ask the nurse to slowly raise the patient to a seated position, then standing position
	- Place the patient back into bed to remain there until you arrive
	- Request an ECG and attach non-invasive monitoring to the patient if syncope was the cause of collapse
	- Request a fingerprick BGL
	- Obtain a lying and standing HR and BP; ask the nurse to wait at least 2 minutes after standing the patient up before taking the observations, then repeat the vital signs every 15 minutes until you arrive at the bedside
	- Ask the nurse to call you back immediately if there is deterioration in the level of consciousness or any cardiorespiratory instability
## Prioritisation
- Attend immediately if the patient remains unconscious and/or the HR or BP are abnormal
- If the patient is alert and conscious with normal vital signs, or following an uncomplicated fall with no injury, there is no immediate urgency to attend
# Common Causes *(Corridor Thoughts)*
- Can remember using the mnemonic: HEAD, HEART, VESSELS
    - CNS (head)
        - Hypoxia (hypoglycemia does not cause syncope)
        - Epilepsy (not a true cause of syncope)
        - Anxiety and hyperventilation
        - Dysfunctional brain stem (basivertebral TIA)
    - Cardiac (heart)
        - Heart attack (ACS)
        - Embolism (PE)
        - Aortic obstruction (IHSS, AS or myxoma)
        - Rhythm disturbance, ventricular
        - Tachycardia
    - Vascular (vessels)
        - Vasovagal (emotional reactions) or Valsalva (micturition, cough, straining etc)
        - Ectopic (and other causes of hypovolemia)
        - Situational
        - Subclavian steal
        - ENT (glossopharyngeal neuralgia)
        - Low systemic vascular resistance
            - autononic dysfunction: Addison’s, diabetic vascular neuropathy
            - Drugs such as CCBs, beta-blockers, anti-hypertensives
        - Sensitive carotid sinus
- Otherwise categorise into causes of syncope and causes of mechanical fall:
	- Syncope
		- Cardiac central vascular
			- [[Arrhythmias#Bradyarrhythmias|Bradyarrhythmias]] (Stokes-Adams attack): sinus arrest, second- and third- degree AV block, sick sinus syndrome, pacemaker malfunction
			- [[Arrhythmias#Tachyarrhythmias|Tachyarrhythmias]]: VT, rapid AF or flutter (±WPW), rapid paroxysmal SVT (±WPW), Torsades de pointes (usually with prolonged QT)
			- Obstructive or low-flow conditions: HCM, aortic stenosis, pulmonary embolism
		- Peripheral vascular orthostatic (postural) hypotension
			- Durg induced: Nitrates, hydralazine, prazosin, ACE-i, antipsychotics, levodopa
			- Volume depletion: GI bleed, ruptured AAA, ectopic pregnancy, dehydration
			- Autonomic failure: Diabetes, Parkinson's disease/plus/Lewy body
		- Vasovagal syncope
			- Excessive vagal tone assocaited with standing, emotion, fear, pain, stress, hunger
		- Situational syncope
			- ↑ intrathoracic pressure from coughing, micturition, swallowing, defecation, sneezing
		- Carotid sinus hypersensitivity causes syncope on turning head, tight neck collar etc
		- Cerebrovascular
			- Subarachnoid haemorrhage
			- Vertebrobasillar insufficiency
			- Subclavian artery steal: extremity exercise leads to vertebrobasilar insuffiency
		- Psychogenic
			- Hyperventilation
			- Psychogenic collapse: diagnosis of exclusion only; look for underlying organic basis first
	- Mechanical falls
		- Can be multifactorial especially in older people; combination of environmental hazards, poor vision, diminished muscular strength and impaired proprioception
		- Neurological
			- Dementia resulting in poor safety awareness
			- Confusion and cognitive impairment
			- Pre-existing weakness
			- Parkinson's disease, or other movement disorders including normal pressure hydrocephalus
			- Cerebellar lesions with ataxia
		- Metabolic disorder
			- Electrolyte abnormality such as hyponatraemia, hypokalaemia, hypoglycaemia, hyperglycaemia
			- Dehydration, renal failure (multifactorial), hepatic failure
		- Drugs
		- Sensory impairment
		- Musculoskeletal
		- Environmental
