# Phone Call/Presentation Questions
- Was the onset sudden or gradual? Sudden onset of a severe headache is a SAH until proven otherwise?
- How bad is the headache?
- What are the vital signs?
- Is there an altered level of consciousness?
- Are there any associated symptoms? Fever is associated with meningitis, vomiting with raised ICP and phonophobia plus photophobia with migraine headache.
- Does the patient regularly suffer from headaches? Do the features of this headache differ from previous headaches?
- Has the patient had a recent LP? Post-LP headache occurs in 10–30% patients.
- What was the reason for admission?
## Instructions Over the Phone
- Ask the nurse to take a full set of vital signs and to assess the patient's neurological status
- Request medication that has relieved the headache in the past, or prescribe a non-narcotic analgesic such as paracetamol 1 g PO or aspirin 300 mg with codeine 8 mg two tablets PO
- Give metoclopramide 10–20 mg IV, together with dispersible aspirin 300 mg three tablets (900 mg) PO if migraine is likely
	- Metoclopramide reduces the pain of migraine in addition to its antiemetic effect
- Ask the nurse to call back in 1 hour if a headache without concerning features has not been relieved by the medication
## Prioritisation
- A sudden severe headache and a headache associated with fever, vomiting or a decreased level of consciousness mandate seeing the patient immediately
- A patient with a chronic or recurrent headache should have analgesia prescribed and be reviewed non-urgently
# Common Causes *(Corridor Thoughts)*
- Secondary headaches:
	- Intracranial
		- Haemorrhage (subarachnoid, intracerebral, subdural)
		- Infection (abscess, meningitis, encephalitis)
		- Posttraumatic (subdural, extradural, cerebral contusion)
		- Cerebral space-occupying lesion (secondary metastasis, primary benign or malignant tumour, abscess, tuberculoma)
		- Cerebral venous sinus thrombosis
		- Idiopathic (benign) intracranial hypertension
		- Cerebral vasculitis such as SLE, RA, PAN, Wegener’s granulomatosis
		- Post-LP
	- Local
		- Glaucoma (always examine for a painful red eye, with a cloudy cornea and ovoid, fixed pupil)
		- Temporal arteritis
		- Vertebral artery dissection
		- Neuralgia (greater occipital, glossopharyngeal, trigeminal)
		- Sinusitis, otitis media, mastoiditis
		- Dental caries, tooth abscess
		- TMJ dysfunction
		- Cervical osteoarthritis
	- Systemic
		- Severe hypertension
		- Systemic infection
		- Hypercapnia
		- Preeclampsia (is the patient pregnant?)
	- Drugs
		- Nitrates
		- Calcium channel blockers
		- NSAIDs
		- Medication overuse headache
- Primary headaches
	- Tension headache
	- Migraine
	- Cluster headache
# Assessment
## End of Bed
- Patients with SAH, meningitis or intracranial herniation look sick, are often in significant pain and frequently have altered mental status
- Patients with migraine are also distressed and sick, but remain fully conscious
## A to E Assessment
- Blood pressure?
	- Severe hypertension (SBP >180mmHg and DBP >120 mmHg) can result in a headache
	- Otherwise, headache is **not** a symptom of headache unless there has been a sudden increase in BP or an associated intracranial bleed
- Heart rate?
	- Hypertension + bradycardia ⇒ ↑ ICP
- Temperature?
	- Fever + headache → immediate blood cultures, IV antibiotics, CT scan and LP if no contraindications
## Initial Examination: Signs of ↑ ICP or Meningitis?

|               | Unequal pupils + ↓ level of consciousness → life threatening. Call for senior help and arrange for intubation, a CT head scan and urgent neurosurgical consult                                                          |
| Skin          | Maculopapular rash (early), petechiae or purpura (later) ⇒ meningococcaemia → call for senior help, take blood cultures immediately and give benzylpenicillin 2.4g IV or ceftriaxone 2g IV if penicillin hypersensitive |
# Immediate Management
- Attach monitoring (non-invasive ECG, BP and pulse oximeter)
- Commence oxygen therapy to maintain oxygen saturation >94%
- Obtain IV access with large-bore 14-16G peripheral cannulae
	- Draw and send blood samples for FBC, coags, UEC, LFT, group and hold and if ? infection two sets of paired blood cultures
- Give antibiotics for suspected meningitis and titrate morphine 2.5mg IV boluses with metoclopramide 10mg IV for SAH
- Request immediate CT head scan if secondary intracranial cause suspected
- LP contraindicated when:
	- Papilloedema
	- Focal neurology incl. altered conscious level
	- Immunosuppression
	- Coagulopathy
## Immediate Specific Management
- Patient unwell with fever, altered mental status, nucal rigidity or photophobia ⇒ bacterial meningitis:
	- Give normal saline to support low BP
	- Give dexamethasone 0.15mg/kg IV with ceftriaxone 4g IV as soon as the diagnosis is suspected
		- Do not delay initial management while awaiting for an LP
	- If altered behaviour, speech disorder, focal neurology or CSF shows atypical leucocytosis (predominantly monocytes) or negative Gram stain for bacteria ⇒ herpes simplex encephalitis → aciclovir 10mg/kg IV
- Patient unwell with fever and there is subdural empyema, brain abscess, suspected infected ventriculoperitoneal shunt → call neurosurgery immediately
- Severe headache, confusion or altered conscious level, nuchal rigidity but no fever ⇒ ? SAH
	- Request urgent non-contrast CT head scan
- Typical aura, no fever, no nuchal rigidity, no confusion and no papilloedema ⇒ migraine headache
	- Other features common: vomiting with photophobia and phonophobia and past history of migraine
	- Never make a first diagnosis of migraine with a defintiive history of previous similar attacks
	- Give metoclopramide 10-20mg IV + NSAID (e.g. aspirin 300mg three tablets = 900mg PO) + commence normal saline at 500mL/h if volume depleted
# Selective History and Chart Review
- Onset sudden or insidious?
	- Sudden onset ⇒ vascular cause e.g. subarachnoid or intracerebral haemorrhage, cerebral venous sinus thrombosis or vertebral or carotid artery dissection
- Headache severity?
	- Sudden onset worst headache ever ⇒ SAH until proven otherwise
	- Migraine headache causes pain bad enough to interfere with normal daily function
	- Muscle contraction headaches (tension) are band-like, mild and rarely incapacitating
- Main site of pain?
	- Unilateral throbbing headache ⇒ migraine
	- Tight band around the head or ache acorss the forehead ⇒ tension headache
	- Lancinating or electric shock pain ⇒ neuralgia
	- Extreme facial or eye pain in short recurring bouts, many months apart ⇒ cluster headache
	- Retro-orbital pain may be caused by orbital lesions including glaucoma, cavernous sinus venous thrombosis, berry aneurysm and SAH, and sphenoid or ethmoid sinusitis
- Affect of posture on headache severity?
	- Tension headache is improved by lying down and resting
	- Headache worse by lying or bending down ⇒ ↑ ICP
	- Headache worse by standing up ⇒ low-pressure syndrome such as post LP headache or spontaneous CSF leak
- Other associated symptoms?
	- Visual aura such as scintillations, zigzag lines, migratory scotomata and tunnel or blurred vision precede a ‘classic migraine’ headache
	- Cluster headaches are associated with unilateral parasympathetic signs such as conjunctival injection, lacrimation, rhinorrhoea, ptosis and miosis on the same side as the pain
	- Clicking or popping when opening or closing the jaw indicates TMJ dysfunction
	- Hearing loss is associated with otitis media and mastoiditis
- Past history of chronic, recurring headaches and what is their pattern?
	- Tension headache is generally mild in the morning and becomes more severe over the day
	- Headache from raised ICP is worse on wakening, with effortless vomiting
	- Migraine headache is commonly unilateral, pulsating or throbbing in nature, is aggravated by movement and is associated with nausea and/or vomiting, photophobia or phonophobia
- Unwell for weeks or months
	- Malaise, scalp tenderness or hyperaesthesiae, jaw claudication, weight loss and shoulder girdle ache ⇒ temporal (giant cell) arteritis ± polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR) in patients older than 50 years
		- Send blood for an ESR, and if raised >50 mm/h start prednisone 60 mg PO immediately
	- Acute angle-closure glaucoma may be precipitated by pupil dilation
		- The patient complains of a severe unilateral headache located over the brow and may develop nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain that can be mistaken for an acute abdomen
- Medication charts
	- Nitrates, calcium-channel blockers, oral contraceptives and NSAIDs can cause headache
	- Anticoagulant therapy (e.g. warfarin or a NOAC) ⇒ ? intracranial haemorrhage → urgent CT head scan + seek senior help to reverse the anticoagulation
		- A low threshold for investigation should also be maintained in elderly patients taking aspirin or clopidogrel, particularly following a fall

> [!NOTE]
>  Relief of pain with analgesia does not aid diagnosis. Do not discount the seriousness of a headache just because it has responded to analgesia, as it can still be a SAH

|             | Unequal pupils or abnormality of conscious level, visual fields, eye movements, limbs, tone, reflexes or plantar responses suggests structural brain disease → make certain an urgent CT head scan has been arranged and you have called your senior |
# Investigations
- Bloods
	- FBC may be unhelpful, as a proportion of patients with meningitis will have a normal WCC and differential
	- Arrange an ESR in patients >50 with suspected temporal arteritis
	- Check coagulation profile if the patient is on anticoagulants or is septic with DIC
- Imaging
	- Arrange urgent CT head scan for:
		- Sudden onset 'thunderclap' headache (SAH)
		- Neurological deficits (other than migrainous aura), altered mental status, papilloedema, nuchal rigidity or seizures, haemorrhage, abscess, vasculitis
		- Recent head trauma (subdual, extradural or intracranial bleed)
		- Patient is on anticoagulation medication
- Proceed to LP and CSF analysis in suspected meningoencephalitis, SAH or benign intracranial hypertension
- If CT scan inconclusive and suspected cerebral venous sinus thrombosis, vasculitis or vertebral or carotid artery dissection → MRI/MRA
# Specific Management
## Meningoencephalitis
- See [[Meningitis]]
- **Presentation:** Generalised headache, fever and vomiting with altered mental status, irritability and drowsiness progressing to coma, neck stiffness and photophobia
- Most often viral but if bacterial: Neisseria meningitidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae (non-vaccinated) and Listeria monocytogenes
	- Viral infection usually causes less severe headache, and may have a typical prodrome, but always do an LP if in any doubt.
	- Suspect herpes simplex virus (HSV) encephalitis if altered level of consciousness, behavioural disturbance, focal neurological deficits or seizures
- Commence antibiotics and/or antiviral therapy as soon as two sets of paired blood cultures have been drawn
	- Do not delay by waiting for a CT scan or LP
- Perform a non-contrast CT head scan before an LP to exclude SAH or unexpected focal mass lesion such as a cerebral abscess
## Subarachnoid Haemorrhage
- **Presentation:** Sudden or ‘thunderclap’, severe, ‘worst-ever’ headache, sometimes following exertion or straining, with nausea, vomiting, altered conscious state and meningism
	- Oculomotor palsy or other focal findings are common
- Give the patient oxygen (aim for oxygen saturation >94%) and nurse head upwards
- Gain IV access and send blood for FBC, coagulation profile, UEC, blood glucose and group & hold
- Attach cardiac monitor and pulse oximeter to the patient
- Give paracetamol 500mg and codeine phosphate 8mg
	- Avoid any NSAID
	- Can give morphine 2.5-5mg IV boluses
- Call senior
- Control agitation or seizure with IV benzodiazepine
- Perform an ECG, request CXR and urgent non-contrast CT head scan
- If CT head normal → LP after >10-12 hours after the headache
	- Send CSF for microscopy, culture, glucose, protein and xanthochromia studies
- Refer to neurosurgery if
	- Diagnosis is confirmed by red cells with xanthochromia or
	- If the CSF analysis for xanthochromia was equivocal
## Space-Occupying Lesion
- Headaches become progressively more frequent and severe, worse in the mornings and exacerbated by coughing, bending or straining
	- Vomiting without nausea and focal neurological signs develop, including subtle personality change, changes in concentration or even disinhibited behaviour
- Fundoscopy can show loss of spontaneous venous pulsation int he central retinal vein and blurring of the optic disc margin
- Arrange an immediate CT head scan and perform CXR to look for primary tumour
- Refer to neurosurgery when confirmed mass lesion
## Temporal Arteritis
- Patients aged >50 years, with diffuse or bitemporal headache associated with a history of malaise, weight loss and myalgia plus shoulder girdle weakness from associated polymyalgia rheumatica
	- Sometimes pain on chewing
- Assess for localised scalp tenderness and hyperaesthesia with temporal artery tenderness
- Send blood for ESR and give prednisolone 60mg immediately
- Arrange for temporal artery biopsy within the next 7 days
## Migraine
- Ask the patient what is usually taken for the migraine and prescribe this immediately
- Alternatively, give an oral analgesic such as aspirin 300mg three tablets (900mg) PO, ibuprofen 600mg PO or paracetamol 1g
- Add metoclopramide 10–20 mg IV and avoid inappropriate opioid analgesia
- If oral analgesia plus metoclopramide fail, give chlorpromazine 12.5–25 mg IV diluted in 500 mL normal saline over 30 minutes and keep the patient in bed (∵ risk of postural hypotension)

> [!NOTE] 
> if you consider a triptan such as sumatriptan 6 mg SC for a resistant headache, make certain there is no risk of coronary artery disease and no ergotamine has been given in the last 24 hours

## Cluster Headache
- Often difficult to treat, discuss with senior and try the following:
	- High flow oxyegn by non-rebreather mask as early as possible to abort an attack
	- Intranasal local anaesthetic spray (e.g. 5% lignocaine bilaterally)
	- Sumatriptan 6mg SC
- Avoid giving morphine
## Post Lumbar Puncture Headache
- Low pressure headache on standing up, within 48 hours of LP usually 2° to continuing CSF leak
- Treat with strict bed rest (no toilet priviledges), oral or IV fluids and regular paracetamol 500mg with codeine phosphate 8mg two tablets PO
- If unsuccessful consider anaesthetist applied epidural blood patch
## Tension Headache
- Oral analgesic such as paracetamol 500mg with codeine phosphate 8mg two tablets 6 hourly PO or ibuprofen 400mg 6 hourly PO
