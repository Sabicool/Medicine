# Phone Call/Presentation Questions
- Was the onset sudden or gradual? Sudden onset of a severe headache is a SAH until proven otherwise?
- How bad is the headache?
- What are the vital signs?
- Is there an altered level of consciousness?
- Are there any associated symptoms? Fever is associated with meningitis, vomiting with raised ICP and phonophobia plus photophobia with migraine headache.
- Does the patient regularly suffer from headaches? Do the features of this headache differ from previous headaches?
- Has the patient had a recent LP? Post-LP headache occurs in 10–30% patients.
- What was the reason for admission?
## Instructions Over the Phone
- Ask the nurse to take a full set of vital signs and to assess the patient's neurological status
- Request medication that has relieved the headache in the past, or prescribe a non-narcotic analgesic such as paracetamol 1 g PO or aspirin 300 mg with codeine 8 mg two tablets PO
- Give metoclopramide 10–20 mg IV, together with dispersible aspirin 300 mg three tablets (900 mg) PO if migraine is likely
	- Metoclopramide reduces the pain of migraine in addition to its antiemetic effect
- Ask the nurse to call back in 1 hour if a headache without concerning features has not been relieved by the medication
## Prioritisation
- A sudden severe headache and a headache associated with fever, vomiting or a decreased level of consciousness mandate seeing the patient immediately
- A patient with a chronic or recurrent headache should have analgesia prescribed and be reviewed non-urgently
# Common Causes *(Corridor Thoughts)*
- Secondary headaches:
	- Intracranial
		- Haemorrhage (subarachnoid, intracerebral, subdural)
		- Infection (abscess, meningitis, encephalitis)
		- Posttraumatic (subdural, extradural, cerebral contusion)
		- Cerebral space-occupying lesion (secondary metastasis, primary benign or malignant tumour, abscess, tuberculoma)
		- Cerebral venous sinus thrombosis
		- Idiopathic (benign) intracranial hypertension
		- Cerebral vasculitis such as SLE, RA, PAN, Wegener’s granulomatosis
		- Post-LP
	- Local
		- Glaucoma (always examine for a painful red eye, with a cloudy cornea and ovoid, fixed pupil)
		- Temporal arteritis
		- Vertebral artery dissection
		- Neuralgia (greater occipital, glossopharyngeal, trigeminal)
		- Sinusitis, otitis media, mastoiditis
		- Dental caries, tooth abscess
		- TMJ dysfunction
		- Cervical osteoarthritis
	- Systemic
		- Severe hypertension
		- Systemic infection
		- Hypercapnia
		- Preeclampsia (is the patient pregnant?)
	- Drugs
		- Nitrates
		- Calcium channel blockers
		- NSAIDs
		- Medication overuse headache
- Primary headaches
	- Tension headache
	- Migraine
	- Cluster headache
# Assessment
## End of Bed
- Patients with SAH, meningitis or intracranial herniation look sick, are often in significant pain and frequently have altered mental status
- Patients with migraine are also distressed and sick, but remain fully conscious
## A to E Assessment
- Blood pressure?
	- Severe hypertension (SBP >180mmHg and DBP >120 mmHg) can result in a headache
	- Otherwise, headache is **not** a symptom of headache unless there has been a sudden increase in BP or an associated intracranial bleed
- Heart rate?
	- Hypertension + bradycardia ⇒ ↑ ICP
- Temperature?
	- Fever + headache → immediate blood cultures, IV antibiotics, CT scan and LP if no contraindications
## Initial Examination: Signs of ↑ ICP or Meningitis?

|               | Unequal pupils + ↓ level of consciousness → life threatening. Call for senior help and arrange for intubation, a CT head scan and urgent neurosurgical consult                                                          |
| Skin          | Maculopapular rash (early), petechiae or purpura (later) ⇒ meningococcaemia → call for senior help, take blood cultures immediately and give benzylpenicillin 2.4g IV or ceftriaxone 2g IV if penicillin hypersensitive |
# Immediate Management
- Attach monitoring (non-invasive ECG, BP and pulse oximeter)
- Commence oxygen therapy to maintain oxygen saturation >94%
- Obtain IV access with large-bore 14-16G peripheral cannulae
	- Draw and send blood samples for FBC, coags, UEC, LFT, group and hold and if ? infection two sets of paired blood cultures
- Give antibiotics for suspected meningitis and titrate morphine 2.5mg IV boluses with metoclopramide 10mg IV for SAH
- Request immediate CT head scan if secondary intracranial cause suspected
- LP contraindicated when:
	- Papilloedema
	- Focal neurology incl. altered conscious level
	- Immunosuppression
	- Coagulopathy
## Immediate Specific Management
- Patient unwell with fever, altered mental status, nucal rigidity or photophobia ⇒ bacterial meningitis:
	- Give normal saline to support low BP
	- Give dexamethasone 0.15mg/kg IV with ceftriaxone 4g IV as soon as the diagnosis is suspected
		- Do not delay initial management while awaiting for an LP
	- If altered behaviour, speech disorder, focal neurology or CSF shows atypical leucocytosis (predominantly monocytes) or negative Gram stain for bacteria ⇒ herpes simplex encephalitis → aciclovir 10mg/kg IV
- Patient unwell with fever and there is subdural empyema, brain abscess, suspected infected ventriculoperitoneal shunt → call neurosurgery immediately
- Severe headache, confusion or altered conscious level, nuchal rigidity but no fever ⇒ ? SAH
	- Request urgent non-contrast CT head scan
- Typical aura, no fever, no nuchal rigidity, no confusion and no papilloedema ⇒ migraine headache
	- Other features common: vomiting with photophobia and phonophobia and past history of migraine
	- Never make a first diagnosis of migraine with a defintiive history of previous similar attacks
	- Give metoclopramide 10-20mg IV + NSAID (e.g. aspirin 300mg three tablets = 900mg PO) + commence normal saline at 500mL/h if volume depleted
# Selective History and Chart Review
- Onset sudden or insidious?
	- Sudden onset ⇒ vascular cause e.g. subarachnoid or intracerebral haemorrhage, cerebral venous sinus thrombosis or vertebral or carotid artery dissection
- Headache severity?
	- Sudden onset worst headache ever ⇒ SAH until proven otherwise
	- Migraine headache causes pain bad enough to interfere with normal daily function
	- Muscle contraction headaches (tension) are band-like, mild and rarely incapacitating
- Main site of pain?
	- Unilateral throbbing headache ⇒ migraine
	- Tight band around the head or ache acorss the forehead ⇒ tension headache
	- Lancinating or electric shock pain ⇒ neuralgia
	- Extreme facial or eye pain in short recurring bouts, many months apart ⇒ cluster headache
	- Retro-orbital pain may be caused by orbital lesions including glaucoma, cavernous sinus venous thrombosis, berry aneurysm and SAH, and sphenoid or ethmoid sinusitis
- Affect of posture on headache severity?
	- Tension headache is improved by lying down and resting
	- Headache worse by lying or bending down ⇒ ↑ ICP
	- Headache worse by standing up ⇒ low-pressure syndrome such as post LP headache or spontaneous CSF leak
- Other associated symptoms?
	- Visual aura such as scintillations, zigzag lines, migratory scotomata and tunnel or blurred vision precede a ‘classic migraine’ headache
