# Phone Call/Presentation Questions
- Was the onset sudden or gradual? Sudden onset of a severe headache is a SAH until proven otherwise?
- How bad is the headache?
- What are the vital signs?
- Is there an altered level of consciousness?
- Are there any associated symptoms? Fever is associated with meningitis, vomiting with raised ICP and phonophobia plus photophobia with migraine headache.
- Does the patient regularly suffer from headaches? Do the features of this headache differ from previous headaches?
- Has the patient had a recent LP? Post-LP headache occurs in 10–30% patients.
- What was the reason for admission?
## Instructions Over the Phone
- Ask the nurse to take a full set of vital signs and to assess the patient's neurological status
- Request medication that has relieved the headache in the past, or prescribe a non-narcotic analgesic such as paracetamol 1 g PO or aspirin 300 mg with codeine 8 mg two tablets PO
- Give metoclopramide 10–20 mg IV, together with dispersible aspirin 300 mg three tablets (900 mg) PO if migraine is likely
	- Metoclopramide reduces the pain of migraine in addition to its antiemetic effect
- Ask the nurse to call back in 1 hour if a headache without concerning features has not been relieved by the medication
## Prioritisation
- A sudden severe headache and a headache associated with fever, vomiting or a decreased level of consciousness mandate seeing the patient immediately
- A patient with a chronic or recurrent headache should have analgesia prescribed and be reviewed non-urgently

		- Post-LP
	- Local
