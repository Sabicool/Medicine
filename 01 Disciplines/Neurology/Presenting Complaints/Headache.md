# Phone Call/Presentation Questions
- Was the onset sudden or gradual? Sudden onset of a severe headache is a SAH until proven otherwise?
- How bad is the headache?
- What are the vital signs?
- Is there an altered level of consciousness?
- Are there any associated symptoms? Fever is associated with meningitis, vomiting with raised ICP and phonophobia plus photophobia with migraine headache.
- Does the patient regularly suffer from headaches? Do the features of this headache differ from previous headaches?
- Has the patient had a recent LP? Post-LP headache occurs in 10–30% patients.
- What was the reason for admission?
## Instructions Over the Phone
- Ask the nurse to take a full set of vital signs and to assess the patient's neurological status
- Request medication that has relieved the headache in the past, or prescribe a non-narcotic analgesic such as paracetamol 1 g PO or aspirin 300 mg with codeine 8 mg two tablets PO
- Give metoclopramide 10–20 mg IV, together with dispersible aspirin 300 mg three tablets (900 mg) PO if migraine is likely
	- Metoclopramide reduces the pain of migraine in addition to its antiemetic effect
- Ask the nurse to call back in 1 hour if a headache without concerning features has not been relieved by the medication
## Prioritisation
- A sudden severe headache and a headache associated with fever, vomiting or a decreased level of consciousness mandate seeing the patient immediately
- A patient with a chronic or recurrent headache should have analgesia prescribed and be reviewed non-urgently
# Common Causes *(Corridor Thoughts)*
- Secondary headaches:
	- Intracranial
		- Haemorrhage (subarachnoid, intracerebral, subdural)
		- Infection (abscess, meningitis, encephalitis)
		- Posttraumatic (subdural, extradural, cerebral contusion)
		- Cerebral space-occupying lesion (secondary metastasis, primary benign or malignant tumour, abscess, tuberculoma)
		- Cerebral venous sinus thrombosis
		- Idiopathic (benign) intracranial hypertension
		- Cerebral vasculitis such as SLE, RA, PAN, Wegener’s granulomatosis
		- Post-LP
	- Local
		- Glaucoma (always examine for a painful red eye, with a cloudy cornea and ovoid, fixed pupil)
		- Temporal arteritis
		- Vertebral artery dissection
		- Neuralgia (greater occipital, glossopharyngeal, trigeminal)
		- Sinusitis, otitis media, mastoiditis
		- Dental caries, tooth abscess
		- TMJ dysfunction
		- Cervical osteoarthritis
	- Systemic
		- Severe hypertension
		- Systemic infection
		- Hypercapnia
		- Preeclampsia (is the patient pregnant?)
	- Drugs
		- Nitrates
		- Calcium channel blockers
		- NSAIDs
		- Medication overuse headache
- Primary headaches
	- Tension headache
	- Migraine
	- Cluster headache
# Assessment
## End of Bed
- Patients with SAH, meningitis or intracranial herniation look sick, are often in significant pain and frequently have altered mental status
- Patients with migraine are also distressed and sick, but remain fully conscious
## A to E Assessment
- Blood pressure?
	- Severe hypertension (SBP >180mmHg and DBP >120 mmHg) can result in a headache
	- Otherwise, headache is **not** a symptom of headache unless there has been a sudden increase in BP or an associated intracranial bleed
- Heart rate?
	- Hypertension + bradycardia ⇒ ↑ ICP
- Temperature?
	- Fever + headache → immediate blood cultures, IV antibiotics, CT scan and LP if no contraindications
## Initial Examination: Signs of ↑ ICP or Meningitis?
