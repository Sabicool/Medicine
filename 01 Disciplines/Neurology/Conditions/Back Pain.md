# Assessment
## While Standing
- Inspect the spine for any developmental or traumatic deformities. 
	- Assess the lumbar lordosis; loss of curvature may indicate ankylosing spondylitis. 
	- Look for any muscle wasting (buttock, thigh, calf). 
	- Check for any discrepancy in leg length by comparing the levels of the iliac crests.
- Movement: 
	- Ask the patient to extend the spine, flex forward and then flex laterally by sliding their palm down their outer thigh
	- Most patients with non-specific back pain will be slightly stiff in extension, have pain on flexion, and asymmetric limitation and pain on lateral flexion.
## While Lying Supine
- Rule out other joint involvement: check the hip joints for range of movement and pain
	- Perform stress test on sacro-iliac joints (e.g. FABER test), especially in young patients
	- Flexion, Abduction, and External Rotation (FABER):
		- The patient lies in a supine position, and the foot is placed on the opposite knee; in this position groin pain indicates a hip problem rather than a spinal problem
		- The doctor then presses on the flexed knee and on the opposite anterior superior iliac crest; pain in the sacroiliac area indicates a problem with sacroiliac joints

- Test nerve roots:
	- Straight leg raise test
		- This stretches nerve roots L4, L5 and S1 
		- Pick the leg up by the ankle
		- While keeping the knee fully extended, lift the leg up towards ninety degrees
		- If the patient has significant nerve root entrapment shooting leg pain will be reproduced before you get much beyond thirty degrees of elevation
			- Back pain produced by straight leg raising is common and does not always indicate nerve root involvement.

- Assess muscle power

| Muscle group                      | Nerve Root |
| --------------------------------- | ---------- |
| Resisted flexion of hip           | L2/3       |
| Resisted knee flexion             | S2         |
| Resisted dorsiflexion of ankle    | L4         |
| Resisted extension of big toe     | L5         |
| Resisted plantar flexion of ankle | S1         |
- Check reflexes:
	- Knee jerk: L3/4
	- Ankle jerk: L5/S1
	- Plantar reflex: observe for up-going plantars
- Check for skin sensory loss

## While Lying Prone
- Femoral stretch test (nerve roots L2/3/4)
	- With the patient lying prone, flex the knee towards ninety degrees
	- Burning discomfort in the groin or anterior thigh will occur if there is femoral nerve involvement
	- ![[Pasted image 20251208212117.png]]
- Palpate the spine for tenderness and for muscle spasm
## While on Side
- For patients who describe loss of sphincter control test for impaired sensation in the saddle area and assess anal sphincter tone with DRE
