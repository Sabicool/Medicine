# Investigations
- Non-contrast CT head within 6 hours
- If normal CT, consider performing an LP but discuss pros and cons with the patient
# Management
- Confirm the diagnosis with CT brain (CTA, CT perfusion, Non-Con CT)
- Aim to decrease the SBP to 160mmHg which can be done by managing the pain with IV morphine and an antiemetic
- Consult senior or neurosurgeon for the choice of antihypertensive if this is not enough
- Consider nimodipine
