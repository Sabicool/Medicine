- About 20% of patients with subarachnoid haemorrhage have a sudden headache several weeks before the acute event
	- This is thought to be due to a sentinel bleed, which is a minor subarachnoid bleed before the main rupture
	- It is a warning sign that must be investigated
# Investigations
- Non-contrast CT head within 6 hours
- If normal CT, consider performing an LP but discuss pros and cons with the patient
# Management
- Confirm the diagnosis with CT brain (CTA, CT perfusion, Non-Con CT)
- A to E resuscitation
- Aim to decrease the SBP to 160mmHg which can be done by managing the pain with IV morphine and an antiemetic
- Consult senior or neurosurgeon for the choice of antihypertensive if this is not enough
- Nimodipine
	- Within 4 days of SAH and usually up to 21 days
	- Oral dose: 60mg every 4 hours (hepatic impairment 30mg every 4 hours)
	- IV infusion: Co-infuse with compatabile solution (e.g. 0.9% normal saline, 5% dextrose) Give infusion via a central catheter using an infusion pump; do not use PVC giving sets because of the loss of nimodipine and contamination by plasticisers; use polyethylene sets
		- Adult >70kg IV 1mg/hour for first 2 hours with the infusion solution at a rate of 20 mL/hour
		- If well tolerated increase dosage up to 2mg/hour up to 2 mg/hour with an increase in the rate of co-infusion solution to 40 mL/hour
		- Adult <70kg or labile BP or hepatic impairment, IV initially 0.5mg/hour; give co-infusion solution at a rate of 10 mL/hour up to a maximum of 1 mg/hour
