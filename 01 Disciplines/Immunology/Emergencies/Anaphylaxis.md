# Management
- Give high-dose oxygen via a mask, aiming for an oxygen saturation >94%
- Give ==0.01 mg/kg adrenaline up to 0.5 mg (0.5 mL of 1:1000 solution) IM== into the upper lateral thigh
- Attach patient to pulse oximetry and ECG monitoring, obtain large IV access
- If no response, treat as **critical anaphylaxis**:
	- Ensure two large-bore IV lines
	- Repeat the dose of ==adrenaline 0.01 mg/kg up to 0.5 mg every 3-5 minutes==
	- Alternatively place ==adrenaline 1mg (1mL of 1:1000) in 100mL of normal saline and administer IV at 60-120 mL/h (10-20 microgram/min)== titrated to response
		- Give faster in cardiac arrest
	- Must be ECG monitor
	- *Hypotension*
		- Lay the patient supine and elevate the legs
		- Give adrenaline as above
		- Give normal saline bolus 20 mL/kg IV under pressure, repeat twice more as necessary
		- Give ==glucagon 1 mg IV== repeated every 5 minutes for patients on a **beta-blocker** who are resistant to the above treatment
			- Beta blockers blunt the affect of adrenaline
			- Glucagon can also cause positive ionotropic and chronotropic effects on the heart and improves vasodilation; also stabilises mast cells
		- Give ==atropine 0.6 mg IV boluses== if bradycardia unresponsive to adrenaline
	- *Cardiac arrest*
		- Give adrenaline 1 mg IV dose and repeat; can use larger doses of adrenaline 3-5 mg IV
		- Deliver rapid boluses up to 60 mL/kg of normal saline
	- *Adjunctive agents*
		- Laryngeal oedema
			- Give 1:1000 adrenaline 5 mg (5 mL) nebulised with oxygen
			- Call anaesthetist and prepare for surgical airway
			- Give hydrocortisone 200 mg IV or prednisone 50 mg PO
			- Give nebulised salbutamol 5 mg and repeat up to continuously as necessary
		- H1 and or H2 antihistamines following recovery from anaphylaxis
				- Cetirizine 10 mg PO or fexofenadine 180 mg plus rantidine 150 mg following recovery from the anaphylaxis
