# Classification
Can be classified by aetiology:
- Primary ⇒ autoimmune disorder characterised by isolated thrombocytopenia (most common)
- Secondary ⇒ secondary to identifiable trigger:
	- Autoimmune disorders -> antiphospholipid syndrome
	- Malignancy -> Lymphoma, Leukaemia (particularly CLL)
	- Infection -> HIV, HCV
	- Drugs -> *many* check AMH
- Can be classified by chronicity:
	- Newly diagnosed ITP => all cases <3 months of diagnosis
	- Persistent ITP => ITP lasting 3-12 months
	- Chronic ITP => ITP lasting >12 months
# Epidemiology
- US Statistics:
	- Females affected more than males
	- Children :: highest prevalence <5 years old; typically self-limiting after viral infection; 80% resolve in 12 months
	- Adults :: highest prevalence in >55 years old; often incidental finding on routine CBC
# Pathophysiology
- Antiplatelet antibodies (mostly IgG directed against GpIIb/IIIa, GpIb/IX, bind to surface proteins on platelets → sequestration by spleen and liver → ↓ platelet count → ↑ bone marrow megakaryocytes and platelet production)
# Clinical Features
- Splenomegaly is typically _absent_ in patients with ITP
- Clinical features can correlate with platelet count; but most patients are asymptomatic:

- Minor mucocutaneous bleeding is possible:
	- Subcutaneous bleeding (e.g. bruising, petechiae, purpura)
	- Mucosal bleeding (e.g. mild epistaxis, gingival bleeding)
# Investigations
- CBC: typically $\pu{100,000 count //mm3}$
- Coagulation panel is usually normal (unless secondary ITP)
- Bleeding time may be ↑
# Diagnosis
- ITP is often a diagnosis of exclusion in patients who have thrombocytopenia with no other abnormalities
# Management
- In all patients stop medications that impair platelet function (e.g. NSAIDs)
## Emergency Treatment
- Indicated for patients with:
	- Life threatening bleeding (typically at platelet $<\pu{20,000 count // mm3}$)
	- Acute neurological features (i.e. intracranial bleed)
	- Anticipated urgent surgery or invasive procedure
## Emergency Management:
1. Haemostatic control of bleeding (if present)
2. Start combination therapy with:
	- Corticosteroids (e.g. methylprednisolone)
	- + IV immunoglobulin
	- + Platelet transfusions as needed
3. If ⌀ response consider thrombopoietin receptor agonist (TPO-RA) e.g. romiplostim
## Conservative Managmenet
- Indicated for asymptomatic or minor mucutaneous bleeding only patients with:
	- Adults with a platelet count $>\pu{30,000 count // mm3}$
	- Children with any platelet count
- Remember to refer to haematology and counsel on bleeding risks[^1]
## First Line Medical Therapy
- Indicated for:
	- Adults with platelet count $<\pu{30,000 count // mm3}$
	- Patients with significant non-life-threatening mucosal bleeding (e.g. severe epistaxis)
	- Symptoms impacting quality of life
- Therapy:
	- Corticosteroids (e.g. dexamethasone or prednisone)
	- If contraindicated or not tolerated: IVIG or anti-Rho(D) immunoglobulin
## Therapy for ITP Refractory to First-Line or Persistent/Chronic ITP
- TPO-RAs (e.g. Romiplostim, Eltrombopag)
- Rituximab
- Splenectomy
  - Indications:
    - Treatment resistent thrombocytopenia lasting >12 months
    - Severe bleeding refractory to other treatment
    - Spleen should be confirmed as primary site of platelet breakdown using radioactively labeled thrombocytes if possible
