# Assessment
- Establish current risk profile
	- Peak flow measurements at home
	- Use of beta-agonists and response to therapy
	- Use of oral steroid or escalation of preventive inhaler use
	- Previous admission(s) to hospital (esp. in last 4 weeks)
- Precipitating factors
	- Viral illness (common)
	- Specific allergies
	- Comorbidities (e.g. obesity, copd, heart failure)
	- Recent beta-blocker or aspirin/NSAID administration
- Socioeconomic challenges
	- Homeless, unemployed, living alone
	- Drug or alcohol use
	- Psychiatric illness

> [!WARNING] Severe attack
> Indicated by any of the following:
> - RR ≥25 breaths/min
> - Tacycardia ≥110 beats/min
> - PEFR or FEV1 = 33-50% of predicted or known, despite nebuliser therapy
> Management includes steroid

> [!WARNING] Life-threatening attack with risk of [[Acute Respiratory Failure]]
> Indicated by any of the following:
> - Silent chest, cyanosis or feeble respiratory effort
> - Bradycardia, arrhythmia or hypotension
> - Altered mental status with exhaustion or confusion
> - $S\ce{\rm{a}O2}$ <92%; $P\ce{\rm{a}O2}$ <60mmHg or normal or raised $Pa\ce{CO2}$ >34-45 mmHg on ABG
> If precipitate onset also consider [[Anaphylaxis]]; look for other features (e.g. urticaria, erythema, pruritis or angio-oedema) 

# Investigations
## Bedside
-  Spirometry and peak expiratory flow rate
-  Arterial blood gases are rarely necessary; only get in severe attack that does not respond to treatment, is deteriorating or has life-threatening features
# Management
- First line management
	- Commence high-dose oxygen via a mask maintaining $S\rm{a}O2$ >95% and attach pulse oximetry monitoring
	- Give ==salbutamol 5mg== via an oxygen-driven nebuliser, diluted with 3mL normal saline
		- Add ==ipratropium 500mcg== to a second dose of ==salbutamol 5mg via the nebuliser== if there is no response or there is a severe attack
		- Give ==prednisolone 50mg PO== or ==hydrocortisone 200mg IV== if unable to swallow
	- Avoid all sedatives, anxiolytics, NSAIDs and histamine-releasers (morphine)
- If patient's condition does not improve
	- Give repeated salbutamol 5mg nebulisers (up to 3 doses in first hour)
	- Continue regular ipratropium 500mcg every 6 hours
- If patient's condition is deteriorating or life-threatening features
	- Obtain IV access, ensure steroids have been given, perform a CXR and call for senior help
	- Give continuous salbutamol nebulisers
