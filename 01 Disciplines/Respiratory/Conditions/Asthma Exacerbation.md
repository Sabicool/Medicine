> [!WARNING] Severe attack
> Indicated by any of the following:
> - RR ≥25 breaths/min
> - Tacycardia ≥110 beats/min
> - PEFR or FEV1 = 33-50% of predicted or known, despite nebuliser therapy
> Management includes steroid

> [!WARNING] Life-threatening attack with risk of [[Acute Respiratory Failure]]
> Indicated by any of the following:
> - Silent chest, cyanosis or feeble respiratory effort
> - Bradycardia, arrhythmia or hypotension
> - Altered mental status with exhaustion or confusion
> - $S\ce{\rm{a}O2}$ <92%; $P\ce{\rm{a}O2}$ <60mmHg or normal or raised $Pa\ce{CO2}$ >34-45 mmHg on ABG
> If precipitate onset also consider [[Anaphylaxis]]; look for other features (e.g. urticaria, erythema, pruritis or angio-oedema) 
# Secondary Assessment
- Secondary assessment to be completed when feasible after starting salbutamol and oxygen
	- Physical examination including vital signs
	- Chest auscultation assessing for signs of complications (e.g. [[Pneumothorax]], [[Pneumonia]])
	- Obtain an ABG if life-threatening acute asthma
	- Obtain a chest radiograph to detect the presence of pneumothorax, consolidation or evidence of heart failure
	- Obtain spirometry when patient able
- Brief history including:
	- Reliever taken for this episode before presentation (dose, number of doses, time of last dose)
	- Whether oral corticosteroid has been started (e.g. from asthma action plan)
	- Current asthma medications
	- Whether the patient has been prescribed a preventer (inhaled corticosteroid or combination of inhaled corticosteroid and long acting beta-2 agonist taken as maintenance or budesonide-formoterol as needed)
		- Ask about adherence
	- What triggered this episode if known (e.g. allergies, medicines, respiratory infections)
		- Rarely triggered by food allergies but food allergy is a risk factor for life-threatening asthma
	- Presence of co-existing heart or lung disease, including [[COPD]]
	- Smoking/vaping status and exposure to environmental smoke/vaping
	- Peak flow measurements at home
	- Previous admission(s) to hospital (esp. in last 4 weeks)
- Socioeconomic challenges
	- Homeless, unemployed, living alone
	- Drug or alcohol use
	- Psychiatric illness
# Additional Therapy
- Start systemic corticosteroids within 1 hour of presentation if indicated; systemic corticosteroids are indicated for all severe and life-threatening acute asthma exacerbations and should be considered in other exacerbations on a case-by-case basis
	- **Adults:** Oral prednisone/prednisolone 37.5–50 mg, then repeat each morning on second and subsequent days (total 5–10 days)
	- **Adolescents:** Oral prednisone/prednisolone 1 mg/kg (maximum 50 mg) once daily for 3–5 days
- Assess clinical response after each dose of bronchodilator
	- If dyspnoea/increased work of breathing is partially relieved within the first 5 minutes, reassess the need for repeated bronchodilator at 15 minutes.
	- If dyspnoea/increased work of breathing is not relieved, or condition deteriorates, repeat bronchodilator dose and consider adding inhaled ipratropium bromide (if not part of initial treatment) or IV magnesium sulfate.
		- **Inhaled ipratropium bromide:** Adults and adolescents: 8 actuations (21 microg/actuation) via pressurised metered-dose inhaler and spacer every 20 minutes for first hour. Repeat 4–6 hourly for 24 hours
		- **Intravenous magnesium sulfate:** Adults and adolescents: 0.2 mmol/kg (maximum 10 mmol) diluted in a compatible solution as a single IV infusion over 20 minutes
# Investigations
## Bedside
-  Spirometry and peak expiratory flow rate
-  Arterial blood gases are rarely necessary; only get in severe attack that does not respond to treatment, is deteriorating or has life-threatening features
# Management
- First line management
	- Commence high-dose oxygen via a mask maintaining $S\rm{a}O2$ >95% and attach pulse oximetry monitoring
	- Give ==salbutamol 5mg== via an oxygen-driven nebuliser, diluted with 3mL normal saline
		- Add ==ipratropium 500mcg== to a second dose of ==salbutamol 5mg via the nebuliser== if there is no response or there is a severe attack
		- Give ==prednisolone 50mg PO== or ==hydrocortisone 200mg IV== if unable to swallow
	- Avoid all sedatives, anxiolytics, NSAIDs and histamine-releasers (morphine)
- If patient's condition does not improve
	- Give repeated ==salbutamol 5mg nebulisers (up to 3 doses in first hour)==
	- Continue regular ==ipratropium 500mcg every 6 hours==
- If patient's condition is deteriorating or life-threatening features
	- Obtain IV access, ensure steroids have been given, perform a CXR and call for senior help
	- Give continuous salbutamol nebulisers
	- Obtain ABG to check $P\ce{\rm{a}CO2}$, pH and potassium which may be 2° low to beta-agonist therapy 
		- Treat if <3.0 mmol/L
	- Start bronchodilator infusion IV with ECG monitoring and arrange ICU bed
	- Give ==magnesium sulfate 2.5g IV (10 mmol) over 20-30 minutes==
	- Give ==salbutamol 250-500 mcg IV over 10 minutes==
		- Follow with infusion of ==salbutamol 5mg in 5% dextrose running at 60mL/h (10mcg/min) initially and titrate up to 120-240mL/h (20-40mcg/min)==
