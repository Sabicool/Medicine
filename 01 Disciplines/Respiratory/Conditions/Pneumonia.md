# Aetiologies
- Common
	- S. pneumoniae >50%
	- H. influenzae especially in COPD
	- Atypicals: Legionella spp., Mycoplasna, Chlamydia
	- Viruses: Influenza, Chickenpox
- Less common
	- S. aureus and gram negatives (esp. in alcoholics)
- Immunosuppression consider pneumocystis jiroveci
# History
- Classic presentation: Dyspnoea, fever, productive cough, pleuritic chest pain and haemoptysis 
	- Other less classic features: Referred upper abdominal pain, diarrhoea, confusion
-  Also consider features suggestive of TB: fever >5 days, night sweats, haemoptysis, weight loss, recent travel or past exposure
# Exam
- Dull percussion note, bronchial breathing
- Usually only localised moist crepitations with diminished breath sounds
# Investigations
## Bedside
- Sputum for microscopy and culture
	- Ziehl-Neelsen staining for TB
- Antigen testing and serology: 
	- Legionella, pneumococcal urinary antigen
	- Respiratory viruses including influenza PCR
## Bloods
- FBC, BSL, UEC, LFT and blood cultures (esp. if severe or hospital-acquired)
## Chest X-ray
- Infiltrates (can be unilateral or bilateral or lobar or patchy)
- Parapneumonic effusion

^pneumonia-cxr

# Management
- High dose oxygen, aiming for oxygen saturation >95%
- Obtain IV access and give normal saline in patients with moderate or severe pneumonia
	- These patients are often dehydrated or have hypovolaemia from sepsis
- Determine severity CAP using SMART-COP score, using CURB-65 or Pneumonia Severity Index (PSI)
	- SMART-COP: ≥5 indicates severe disease requiring hospital admission, empirical IV antibiotics and referral to intensive care

## Antibiotic Therapy
### CAP
- Mild CAP:
	- ==Amoxicillin 1g PO 8 hourly for 5-7 days==
	- If Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydophila pneumoniae or Legionella suspected give ==doxycycline 100mg PO 12 hourly for 5-7 days== instead
		- Also add doxycycline if failing to improve by 48 hours
	- If hypersensitivity to pencillin give doxycycline or ==moxifloxacin 400 mg PO daily==
- Moderate CAP:
	- ==Benzylpenicillin 1.2g IV 6-hourly== until imrpovement then change to ==amoxicillin 1g PO 8 hourly for 7 days== + (==doxycycline 100 mg PO 12-hourly for 7 days== or ==Clarithromycin 500 mg PO 12 hourly for 7 days== (if pregnant))
	- Add ==gentamicin 5mg/kg IV daily== (if renal function normal) or change the benzylpenicillin to ==ceftriaxone 1g daily IV== if Gram-negative bacili are identified in blood or sputum 
	- Consider ==oseltamivir 75mg BD PO== in the influenza season
- Severe CAP (SMART-COP ≥5 or CURB-65 ≥3)
	- Refer to HDU/ICU
	- Give ==ceftriaxone 1g IV daily== + ==azithromycin 500 mg IV daily==
		- If renal impairment or pencillin allergy give ==moxifloxacin 400 mg IV daily==
### HAP (develops ≥48 hours in hospital)
- Consult with microbiology or infectious disease
- Amoxicilling-clavulanic acid in mild pneumonia
	- Ticarcillin-clavulanic acid, ceftriaxone or piperacillin-tazobactam in moderate or severe pneumonia.
- Add vancomycin if high prevalence of MRSA and consider ciprofloxacin plus azithromycin if Legionella suspected
### Aspiration pneumonia
- Consider in patients with ↓LOC or ↓cough reflex (e.g ETOH, stroke, seizure, postsurgery)
- Minor aspiration doers not require antibiotics; *only reat aspiration pneumonia*
- Manage aspiration pneumonia as community- (<48 hours) or hospital-acquired (>48 hours) pneumonia initially depending on their length of stay in hospital
- Review patient next day and consider stopping antibiotics if improving and aspiration pneumonitis likely
