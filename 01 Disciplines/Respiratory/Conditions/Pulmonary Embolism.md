# Presentation
- See: [[Shortness of Breath, Cough and Haemopytsis|Dyspnoea]]
- A small PE causes sudden dyspnoea, pleuritic pain and possibly haemoptysis, with few physical signs. Look for a low-grade pyrexia (>38°C), tachypnoea (>20/min), tachycardia and a pleural rub
- A major PE causes dyspnoea, chest pain and light-headedness or collapse, followed by recovery. Look for cyanosis, tachycardia, hypotension, a parasternal heave, raised JVP and a loud delayed pulmonary second sound
# Investigations
## Bedside
### Bloods
- Consider performing an ABG
	- Do not routinely unless pulse oximetry is unreliable or demonstrates unexplained hypoxia on room air
	- Low Pa$\ce{O2}$, Low $\ce{CO2}$, High pH
	- Characteristic findings include acute respiratory alkalosis, or hypoxia and a raised A-a gradient
- D-dimer
	- Age adjusted cutoff 0.01 x age if >50 y/o
### ECG
- Significant PE may cause right axis deviation and right BBB but most common sign is sinus tachycardia (S1Q3T3 is neither specific nor sensitive for PE)

## Imaging
- **Calculate the clinical pre-test probability of PE before requesting any diagnostic imaging**
![[Pasted image 20241220000712.png]]
- Can use D-dimer to exclude PE in low probability pre-test patients
- Can use ELISA D-dimer to exclude PE in moderate probability pre-test patients

> [!NOTE] 
> Only send a D-dimer test in 
> - Patients ≥50 years with a low pre-test probability or
> - In any patient <50 with a low pre-test probability but who fails to fulfil one or more PERC criteria
> 	- If all PERC criteria are fulfilled, the patients does not have a PE and does not need a D-dimer test sent

> [!NOTE] 
>  Patients with high pre-test probability should be commenced on treatment if there are no contra-indications. Treatment can commence prior to definitive imaging. Consideration should be given to treating low and moderate risk patients with positive D-Dimer and no contra-indications.

- PERC needs to be 0 to rule out PE
- If PERC positive -> YEARS score + D-dimer
- Arrange a CTPA or V/Q scan in:
	- All patients with a high or intermediate pre-test probability
	- Those with a positive D-dimer
### CTPA
- CTPA has >95% sensitivity for segmental or larger PEs and ~75% for subsegmental
- CTPA is the preferred first line imaging except for patients <40 years with a normal XR chest where V/Q scan is available within hours
- Contrast-induced risks in patients with renal insufficiency can be mitigated with:
	- IV pre-hydration and adequate hydration afterwards
	- Witholding metformin, NSAIDs, ACE-i
- More useful if the CXR is abnormal (V/Q scan is difficult to interpret in these cases and indertiminate result more likely)
- Arrange sequential V/Q scan ±lower limb Doppler u/s or CT venogram if doubt remains
### V/Q Scan
- V/Q scan preferred over CTPA if:
	- Patient is allergic to contrast dye
	- Patient has renal failure
	- When the CXR is normal
	- Younger females
- A normal V/Q scan rules out clinically important PE in patients with low-to-moderate pre-test probability

### Chest-Xray
- Frequently normal; mainly to exclude other diagnoses such as pneumonia or pneumothorax
- Plate or linear atelactasis
- Unilateral pleural based wedge shaped pulmonary infiltrate
- Unilateral pleural effusion
- Raised hemidiaphragm
- Dilated pulmonary artery in massive PE
- Areas of oligaemia in massive PE

### Pregnancy 
- D-dimer cannot be used for risk stratification in pregnant patients
- Lower limb ultrasound remains the first test of choice
- In suspected PE in pregnancy, if compression ultrasonography of the legs is normal and a XR chest has not further aided the diagnostic process, the decision then needed is whether to investigate further with CTPA or V/Q or treat empirically

> [!NOTE] Risks
> - The average human receives about 3mSv of “background” radiation per year. In general, the comparative radiation dose to a patient with CTPA is 12 mSv whilst it is 2.3mSv with V/Q scan.
> - The natural background dose for a foetus during pregnancy is 1.1-2.5mGy. The foetal dose of radiation from CTPA is 0.37mGy, whilst it is 0.4mGy from a V/Q scan in early pregnancy and 0.75mGy at 6 months. The risk of childhood cancer in exposed offspring is slightly higher with V/Q scan than with CTPA (1 in 280,000 for V/Q and %3C1 in 1,000,000 for CTPA)

# Management
![[Pasted image 20250920175714.png]]
## General measures
- Give high-dose oxygen via mask, aiming for oxygen saturation >95%
- Baseline tests before anticoagulant therapy:
	- Coagulation profile, FBC, EUC, LFT
	- Women of childbearing age: beta-HCG
- Give IV normal saline to support BP if necessary
	- Avoid excessive fluid ∵ worsens RV dilation → septal shift → worsens LV function 
- Vasopressors: Norad first line, dobutamine
- Relieve pain with titrated morphine 2.5 mg IV boluses
- Can use PESI score or simplified PESI score to determine risk of 30 day mortality
- Measure weight and creatinine clearance before selecting anticoaglant
## Anticoagulation
- Commence anticoagulation when:
	- The diagnosis is confirmed or
	- When there is an intermediate or high pre-test probability of PE but a delay to testing (in the absence of contraindications)
- 2 anticoagulation options exist:
	- Start heparin and warfarin and continue heparin until warfarinisation achieved (3-5 days)
	- NOAC
- Duration
	- Provoked: minimum 3 months
	- Unprovoked: >3 months
	- Cancer associated: >6 months
		- Can use DOAC or clexane
			- LMWH for GI/GI cancers and high bleeding risk
		- DOAC can be used for lung, breast, prostate, haem (unless thrombocytopenia), ovarian, brain
### Heparin + Warfarin
- Give LMWH such as enoxaparin 1mg/kg SC BD
	- LMWH does not require aPTT monitoring
- In patients with haemodynamic compromise, give UFH (80 U/kg IV bolus) followed by maintenance infusion of 18 U/kg/h titrated to aPTT (1.5-2.5x control value)
- If patient already on warfarin and has a PE consult cardiothoracics for consideration of transvenous vena caval filter
- Commence first dose of warfarin 5mg PO on the first day of heparin therapy and titrate ssubsequent daily doses to achieve an INR of 2.5-3.5
### NOAC/DOAC
- NOAC such as rivaroxaban 15mg PO 12 hourly or apixabanm 10mg PO 12-hourly 
- Check renal function
- Cannot use in child-pugh class B or worse without specialist input
> [!WARNING] Dabigatran
> Dabigatran requires at least 5 days of parenteral anticoagulant to be given first. Dose is 150mg PO 12-hourly. Dose modification is required based of renal function
## Fibrinolytic Therapy
![[Pasted image 20250920182356.png]]
- Consider when the probability of PE is high (or confirmed) and:
	- The patient is hypotensive despite fluid resuscitation and/or
	- Has evidence of acute RV failure and/or
	- Is peri-arrest
- High risk (previously massive) PE:
	- Acute PE (confirmed on VQ, CTPA or bedside echocardiogram) accompanied by any of:
		- Sustained hypotension (systolic BP <90 mmHg for at least 15 min or requiring ionotropic support not due to a cause other than PE)
		- Pulselessness
		- Persistent profound bradycardia (heart rate <40 bpm with symptoms or signs of shock)
- Intermediate high risk (previously sub-massive) PE:
	- Acute PE without systemic hypotension (systolic BP >90 mmHg) but with either right ventricular dysfunction and/or myocardial necrosis:
		- RV dysfunction defined as at least one of:
			- RV dilation (apical 4-chamber RV diameter divided by LV diameter ≥0.9) or RV systolic dysfunction on echocardiography
			- RV dilation (4 chamber RV diameter divided by LV diameter ≥0.9) on CT
			- Elevation of BNP (>90 pg/mL) or pro BNP (>500 pg/mL)
			- ECG changes indicating RV dysfunction (new RBBB, anteroseptal ST elevation or depression or T wave inversion)
		- Myocardial necrosis defined by:
			- Elevation of troponin T >50ng/L
- Call immediate senior help and [[MET Activation Criteria]]
- Give tPA 10mg IV over 1-2 minutes then 90 mg IV over 2 hours together with heparinisation
	- Can consider streptokinase and urokinase
- Stat fibrinolytic doses can be given in cases of cardiac arrest considered related to a massive PE
- Catheter directed thrombolysis indicated for patients with acute PE associated with hypotension who have:
	- High bleeding risk
	- Failed systemic thrombolysis
	- Shock that is likely to cause death before systemic thrombolysis can take effect (e.g. within hours)
