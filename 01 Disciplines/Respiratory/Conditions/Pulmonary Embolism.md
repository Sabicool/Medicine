# Presentation
- See: [[Shortness of Breath, Cough and Haemopytsis|Dyspnoea]]
- A small PE causes sudden dyspnoea, pleuritic pain and possibly haemoptysis, with few physical signs. Look for a low-grade pyrexia (>38°C), tachypnoea (>20/min), tachycardia and a pleural rub
- A major PE causes dyspnoea, chest pain and light-headedness or collapse, followed by recovery. Look for cyanosis, tachycardia, hypotension, a parasternal heave, raised JVP and a loud delayed pulmonary second sound
# Investigations
## Bedside
### Bloods
- Consider performing an ABG
	- Do not routinely unless pulse oximetry is reliable or demonstrates unexplained hypoxia on room air
	- Characteristic findings include acute respiratory alkalosis, or hypoxia and a raised A-a gradient
### ECG
- Significant PE may cause right axis deviation and right BBB but most common sign is sinus tachycardia (S1Q3T3 is neither specific nor sensitive for PE)

## Imaging
- **Calculate the clinical pre-test probability of PE before requesting any diagnostic imaging**
![[Pasted image 20241220000712.png]]
- Can use D-dimer to exclude PE in low probability pre-test patients
- Can use ELISA D-dimer to exclude PE in moderate probability pre-test patients

> [!NOTE] 
> Only send a D-dimer test in 
> - Patients ≥50 years with a low pre-test probability or
> - In any patient <50 with a low pre-test probability but who fails to fulfil one or more PERC criteria
> 	- If all PERC criteria are fulfilled, the patients does not ahve a PE and does not need a D-dimer test sent

- Arrange a CTPA or V/Q scan in:
	- All patients with a high or intermediate pre-test probability
	- Those with a positive D-dimer
### CTPA
- CTPA has >95% sensitivity for segmental or larger PEs and ~75% for subsegmental
- More useful if the CXR is abnormal (V/Q scan is difficult to interpret)
- Arrange sequential V/Q scan ±lower limb Doppler u/s or CT venogram if doubt remains
### V/Q Scan
- V/Q scan preferred over CTPA if:
	- Patient is allergic to contrast dye
	- Patient has renal failure
	- When the CXR is normal
	- Younger females
- A normal V/Q scan rules out clinically important PE in patients with low-to-moderate pre-test probability

### Chest-Xray
- Frequently normal; mainly to exclude other diagnoses such as pneumonia or pneumothorax
- Plate or linear atelactasis
- Unilateral pleural based wedge shaped pulmonary infiltrate
- Unilateral pleural effusion
- Raised hemidiaphragm
- Dilated pulmonary artery in massive PE
- Areas of oligaemia in massive PE

# Management
- Give high-dose oxygen via mask, aiming for oxygen saturation >95%
- Give IV normal saline to support BP if necessary
	- Avoid excessive fluid ∵ worsens RV dilation → septal shift → worsens LV function 
- Relieve pain with titrated morphine 2.5 mg IV boluses
## Anticoagulation
