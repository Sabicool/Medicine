# Aetiologies
- Bronchospasm, sputum plugging, pneumothorax, viral illness, pneumonia
- Right, left or biventricular failure; arrhythmia (e.g. AF)
- [[Acute Coronary Syndromes|ACS]]
- [[Pulmonary Embolism|PE]]
- Malignancy
- Drug non-compliance, inadequate steroid, inappropriate sedation
- Environment allergens, weather change
# History
- Objective: gain an idea of baseline capacity and elicit cause of exacerbation:
	- Usual and current daily exercise capacity and level of dependence
	- Home oxygen use
	- Smoking or dust exposure
	- New features of cardiac or respiratory disease
	- Episodes of ischaemic or pleuritic chest pain
	- Worsening peripheral oedema or orthopnoea
	- Non-compliance with medication, including steroids or diuretics
	- Excess sedatives or opioids
	- Known cardiac disease
- Indications for hospital admission for a COPD exacerbation (COPD exacerbations can often be managed in the community without referral or admission to hospital as from [eTG](https://app-tg-org.au.eu1.proxy.openathens.net/viewTopic?etgAccess=true&guidelinePage=Respiratory&topicfile=chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease-exacerbations&guidelinename=Respiratory&sectionId=toc_d1e88#toc_d1e88))
	- inadequate response to ambulatory management
	- inability to walk between rooms (in patients who are usually mobile)
	- inability to eat or sleep because of dyspnoea
	- inability to manage at home, even with home-care resources
	- high-risk comorbidity-pulmonary (eg pneumonia) or nonpulmonary
	- altered mental status suggestive of hypercapnia
	- worsening hypoxaemia or cor pulmonale
	- worsening or new-onset central cyanosis
	- newly occurring arrhythmia
	- development of peripheral oedema
	- haemodynamic instability
	- acute respiratory failure
	- onset of new physical signs (eg peripheral oedema).
# Examination
- Hyperexpanded, barrel-shaped chest, ↑WOB
- Fever, wheeze, sputum production
- Cor pulmonale - right [[Heart Failure]] 2° to [[Pulmonary Hypertension]]
# Investigations
## Bedside
- ABG (or VBG + pulse oximetry)
	- Perform an ABG only if:
		- Severe episode
		- No response to treatment
		- Any suggestion of acute or worsening $\ce{CO2}$ retention with altered mental status
	- Chronic $\ce{CO2}$ retention is indicated by a raised $\ce{HCO3-}$ from metabolic compensation; a pH <7.3 suggests acute respiratory acidosis
- Spirometry and PEFR
	- Spirometry during an acute episode is inaccurate and may distress the patient
- ECG looking for:
	- Large P waves (P pulmonale)
	- RVH or strain, multifocal atrial tachycardia or AF
	- Signs of ischaemia
- Respiratory viral swabs
- Sputum culture is not routinely recommended for COPD exacerbations as many patients with COPD are colonised with *Haemophilus influenzae*, *Moraxella catarrhalis* or *Streptococcus pneumoniae*
	- Consider sputum culture for patients with a COPD exacerbation and ≥1 of the following:
		- Severe airflow obstruction (FEV1 < 50% of predicted)
		- Frequent COPD exacerbations (≥2 per year)
		- Current or recent hospitalisation (within past 3 months)
		- Recent isolation of or known colonisation with *Pseudomonas aeruginosa* within the past 3 months
		- Supplemental home oxygen therapy
## Bloods
- CRP can help to determine the presence of bacterial infection in COPD exacerbations and subsequently the potential benefit of antibiotic therapy
## CXR
- May show features suggestive of COPD as well as complications (e.g. atelactasis, consolidation, pneumothorax, pulmonary oedema or malignancy)
# Management
- Oxygen therapy:
	- If evidence of $\ce{CO2}$ retention (raised $\ce{HCO3-}$ or $P\ce{\rm{}aCO2}$) → Controlled oxygen therapy initially at 28% via a Venturi mask
	- Otherwise → higher dose oxygen (40-60%) mask
- Cardiac monitoring and pulse oximeter
- Bronchodilator therapy:
	- Hold all home bronchodilators
	- pMDI with spacer option (for patients with FEV1 >30% of predicted)
		- ==Salbutamol 100mcg per puff for up to 8 puffs at a time via a pMDI with spacer repeated as required== or
		- ==terbutaline 500 mcg per actuation, 1 or 2 actuations via DPI== or (except in those taking a LAMA)
		- ==ipratropium 21 mcg per actuation, up to 4 actuations (one at a time via pMDI with spacer)
	- Nebuliser option
		- ==Salbutamol 2.5 to 5mg via nebuliser== to the initial three nebulisers then give 6 hourly
			- ==ipratropium 250 to 500mcg== can be used instead or if symptoms are severe can be combined
			- Ipratropium has a slower onset of effect than salbutamol
			- Ipratropium is contraindicated in patients taking LAMAs
			- If a nebuliser is required, it should be driven by compressed air rather than oxygen to avoid hyperoxygenation
- Corticosteroid therapy
	- ==Prednisolone 50mg PO== or ==hydrocortisone 200mg IV== if unable to swallow if:
		- Patient has bronchospasm or
		- Patient is on long-term inhaled or oral steroids
		- eTG also recommends 5 day course of steroids for exacerbations that don't respond sufficiently to inhaled bronchodilators; dosage options include:
			- ==Prednisolone 30-50mg PO OD for 5 days==
			- ==Hydrocortisone 50mg IV 6 hourly until oral intake is tolerated==
- Antibiotic therapy
	- Determine if antibiotic therapy is indicated:
		- A bacterial cause of the COPD exacerbation is more likely if the patient has an acute increase in dyspnoea together with **both** of the following clinical features:
			- increased sputum volume
			- sputum purulence or a change in sputum colour.
		- Sputum culture is not routinely recommended for exacerbations of COPD
	- Treat infection with antibiotics depending on guidelines (==Amoxicillin 500 mg PO 8-hourly, amoxicillin 1 g PO 12-hourly or doxycycline 200 mg PO once, then 100mg daily== usually for 5 days)
	- Lack of a response to initial antibiotic therapy for COPD exacerbation rarely requires switching to broader spectrum antibiotics => in mild COPD, symptoms can last for 7-10 days and in moderate-severe COPD, symptoms can persist for weeks
		- Evaluate patients who are deteriorating or not improving for comon viral and non-infective causes of COPD exacerbations and consider other diagnosis such as [[Pneumonia]], [[Acute Pulmonary Oedema]]
		- For patients with severe COPD who have a COPD exacerbation that does not resposne to initial antibiotic therapy after 48-72 hours and if bacterial infection remains the likely cause consider ==amoxicillin + clavulanate 875+125 mg PO, 12-hourly for 5 days==
		- If *P. aeruginosa* is identified in sputum (current isolation or known colonisation in past 3 months) consider ==ciprofloxacin 750 mg PO 12-hourly for 5 days==

- If RV [[Heart Failure]] with fluid overload → ==Frusemide 40mg IV or PO==
- If no response to above and ongoing hypoxial ($\rm{}\ce{SpO2}$<85%), extreme respiratory distress, ↑ $P\rm{}a\ce{CO2}$, patient is exhausted or acidaemia is worsening then commence non-invasive BiPAP ventilation

> [!NOTE] Approaching COPD and possible pneumonia
>  1. Start on antibiotic coverage for pneumonia (e.g., ceftriaxone plus azithromycin) and check a procalcitonin. 
>  2. If procalcitonin is low (<0.5 ng/ml), this argues against typical bacterial pneumonia. Ceftriaxone can be discontinued, while azithromycin is continued to treat COPD. 
>  3. If procalcitonin is elevated, then continue combination antibiotic therapy for pneumonia (along with full-bore COPD therapy as well – the presence of PNA doesn't exclude concomitant COPD).

	- A combination of BiPAP and anxiolytics may be very helpful in breaking patients out of a Flash AECOPD
