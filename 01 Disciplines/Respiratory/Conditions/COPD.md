# Presentation
- Patients have breathlessness, cough, sputum production and wheeze, and are susceptible to infections. Most patients have a smoking history. 
- Bronchiectasis is a less common cause of obstructive lung disease with chronic productive cough, and halitosis. 
- Chronic bronchitis, emphysema and asthma overlap, as some reversibility is present with COPD and some patients with asthma will develop irreversible components of the disease
- Typically older than 35 who are smokers or ex smokers with breathlessness, cough, recurrent respiratory tract infection, sputum production
- Suspect alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency in patients in whom COPD develops at a young age (<40 years), particularly if they have a family history of COPD
# Investigations
## Lung Function Testing
- A postbronchodilator FEV1/FVC ratio less than 0.7 is diagnostic of COPD.
## Chest-Xray
- Hyperinflation of the lungs with flattened diaphragms
- Increased anteroposterior diameter
- Occasional infiltrates
- Occasionally pneumomediastinum

# Management of Stable COPD
- Non-pharmacological
	- Smoking cessation
	- Physical activity
	- Pulmonary rehabilitation
	- Maintenance of up-to-date vaccination
	- Good nutrition
