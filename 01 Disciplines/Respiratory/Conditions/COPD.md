# Presentation
- Patients have breathlessness, cough, sputum production and wheeze, and are susceptible to infections. Most patients have a smoking history. 
- Bronchiectasis is a less common cause of obstructive lung disease with chronic productive cough, and halitosis. 
- Chronic bronchitis, emphysema and asthma overlap, as some reversibility is present with COPD and some patients with asthma will develop irreversible components of the disease.
# Exacerbation of COPD
## Aetiologies
- Bronchospasm, sputum plugging, pneumothorax, viral illness, pneumonia
- Right, left or biventricular failure; arrhythmia (e.g. AF)
- [[Acute Coronary Syndromes|ACS]]
- [[Pulmonary Embolism|PE]]
- Malignancy
- Drug non-compliance, inadequate steroid, inappropriate sedation
- Environment allergens, weather change
## History
- Objective: gain an idea of baseline capacity and elicit cause of exacerbation:
	- Usual and current daily exercise capacity and level of dependence
	- Home oxygen use
	- Smoking or dust exposure
	- New features of cardiac or respiratory disease
	- Episodes of ischaemic or pleuritic chest pain
	- Worsening peripheral oedema or orthopnoea
	- Non-compliance with medication, including steroids or diuretics
	- Excess sedatives or opioids
	- Known cardiac disease
## Examination
- Hyperexpanded, barrel-shaped chest, ↑WOB
- Fever, wheeze, sputum production
- Cor pulmonale - right [[Heart Failure]] 2° to [[Pulmonary Hypertension]]
## Investigations
### Bedside
- ABG (or VBG + pulse oximetry)
	- Perform an ABG only if:
		- Severe episode
		- No response to treatment
		- Any suggestion of acute or worsening $\ce{CO2}$ retention with altered mental status
	- Chronic $\ce{CO2}$ retention is indicated by a raised $\ce{HCO3-}$ from metabolic compensation; a pH <7.3 suggests acute respiratory acidosis
- Spirometry and PEFR
	- Spirometry during an acute episode is inaccurate and may distress the patient
- ECG looking for:
	- Large P waves (P pulmonale)
	- RVH or strain, multifocal atrial tachycardia or AF
	- Signs of ischaemia
### CXR
- May show features suggestive of COPD as well as complications (e.g. atelactasis, consolidation, pneumothorax, pulmonary oedema or malignancy)
## Management
- Oxygen therapy:
	- If evidence of $\ce{CO2}$ retention (raised $\ce{HCO3-}$ or $P\ce{\rm{}aCO2}$) → Controlled oxygen therapy initially at 28% via a Venturi mask
	- Otherwise → higher dose oxygen (40-60%) mask
- Cardiac monitoring and pulse oximeter
- ==Salbutamol 5mg via nebuliser== and ==ipratropium 500mcg to the initial three nebulisers== then give both 6 hourly
- ==Prednisolone 50mg PO== or ==hydrocortisone 200mg IV== if unable to swallow if:
	- Patient has bronchospasm or
	- Patient is on long-term inhaled or oral steroids
- Treat infection with antibiotics depending on guidelines (==Amoxicillin 500mg PO 8-hourly or doxycycline 200mg PO once, then 100mg daily==)
- If RV [[Heart Failure]] with fluid overload → ==Frusemide 40mg IV or PO==
- If no response to above and ongoing hypoxial ($\rm{}\ce{SpO2}$<85%), extreme respiratory distress, ↑ $P\rm{}a\ce{CO2}$, patient is exhausted or acidaemia is worsening then commence non-invasive BiPAP ventilation
# Investigations
## Chest-Xray
- Hyperinflation of the lungs with flattened diaphragms
- Increased anteroposterior diameter
- Occasional infiltrates
- Occasionally pneumomediastinum
