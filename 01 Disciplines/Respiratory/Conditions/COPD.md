# Presentation
- Patients have breathlessness, cough, sputum production and wheeze, and are susceptible to infections. Most patients have a smoking history. 
- Bronchiectasis is a less common cause of obstructive lung disease with chronic productive cough, and halitosis. 
- Chronic bronchitis, emphysema and asthma overlap, as some reversibility is present with COPD and some patients with asthma will develop irreversible components of the disease
- Typically older than 35 who are smokers or ex smokers with breathlessness, cough, recurrent respiratory tract infection, sputum production
- Suspect alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency in patients in whom COPD develops at a young age (<40 years), particularly if they have a family history of COPD
## Differences with [[Asthma]]
- COPD features:
	- Onset after age 40
	- Persistent airflow limitation
	- Lack of response to asthma therapy (e.g. symptoms persisting despite ICS treatment)
	- Heavy tobacco smoke exposure
- Asthma features:
	- Onset before age 20
	- Significant day-to-day variability in airflow limitation and symptoms
	- normal lung function between symptoms
	- Symptoms worse at night or in the early morning
	- Family history of asthma or atopy
	- Seasonal variability in symptoms
	- Spontaneous improvement in symptoms
# Investigations
## Lung Function Testing
- A postbronchodilator FEV1/FVC ratio less than 0.7 is diagnostic of COPD.
## Chest-Xray
- Hyperinflation of the lungs with flattened diaphragms
- Increased anteroposterior diameter
- Occasional infiltrates
- Occasionally pneumomediastinum

# Management of Stable COPD
- Non-pharmacological
	- Smoking cessation
	- Physical activity
	- Pulmonary rehabilitation
	- Maintenance of up-to-date vaccination
	- Good nutrition
- Pharmacological
	- Usually progresses int he following order
		- SABA (salbutamol 100-200 mcg PRN or terbutaline 500 mcg PRN)
		- LABA or LAMA monotherapy
			- Indicated when SABA and non-pharm measures not adequate
			- Options include:
				- LAMA: aclidinium, glycopyrronium, tiotropium, umeclidinium
				- LABA: indacaterol
		- LABA + LAMA
		- LABA + LAMA + ICS
			- Indicated if both:
				- Patient has severe exacerbations (requiring hospitalisation) or at least two moderate exacerbations in previous 12 months and
				- Patient has significant symptoms despite dual therapy with LAMA + LABA
	- Assess 3-6 months after starting treatment and in those who remain symptomatic or have continued exacerbations, check inhaler technique and adherence before stepping up therapy
- Additional therapy
	- Home oxygen
	- Oral mucolytics (bromhexine)
	- Long term macrolide antibiotics

## Other Notes on Management
- Beta blockers should not be stopped in patients with COPD and [[Heart Failure|HFrEF]] or a [[Acute Coronary Syndromes|Myocardial Infarction]] within the last 3 years
- Patients with COPD are at an increased risk of bone fractures; identify patients with [[Osteoporosis]]
- Limit the use of oral corticosteroids in patients with COPD and diabetes
- Mild to moderate [[Pulmonary Hypertension]] is common in patients with COPD
