- Bronchiectasis is a less common cause of obstructive lung disease with chronic productive cough, and halitosis. 
- Chronic bronchitis, emphysema and asthma overlap, as some reversibility is present with COPD and some patients with asthma will develop irreversible components of the disease.

- Hyperinflation of the lungs with flattened diaphragms
- Increased anteroposterior diameter
