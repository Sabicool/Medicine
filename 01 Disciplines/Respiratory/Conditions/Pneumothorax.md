# Definitions
- Primary spontaneous pneumothorax is pneumothorax occurring when there is no known underlying pathology, and no precipitant such as trauma or surgery
- Secondary spontaneous pneumothorax is pneumothorax occurring as a complication of underlying lung disease
# History
- Chest pain is sudden, described as stabbing, radiating to ipsilateral shoulder and pleuritic
- Sudden onset shortness of breath
- Anxiety, cough and vague chest symptoms
# Examination
- Involved hemithorax is hyperexpanded, hyperresonant and has ↓ breath sounds and air entry
- The affected side may have
	- Decreased lung expansion
	- Decreased or absent breath sounds
	- Hyper-resonance on percussion
# Investigations
## Imaging
- Bedside ultrasound[^1]
	- Demonstrates the absence of lung sliding (barcode sign)
- **Inspiratory** erect CXR (standard CXR)[^2]but can request expiratory CXR if in doubt
	- Shows collapsed lung with visible pleural edge and air in the pleural cavity
	- Assess size:
		- Small = visible air rim <2cm
		- Large = visible air rim ≥2cm around all the lung edge
- CT scanning is recommend for uncertain or complex cases
# Management
1. Determine degree of breathlessness
2. Determine size of pneumothorax
	- British thoracic guidelines: large = >2cm between lung margin and chest wall at level of hilum
	- Americal college of chest physicians = >3cm between lung apex and cupola

# Disposition and Follow Up
- Patients should receive verbal and written advice to return immediately to ED if they develop further breathlessness
- All patients should have follow up ideally by a respiratory physician to ensure resolution of pneumothorax and institute optimal care
- Those managed by Observation or needle aspiration should return for a follow up CXR after 2-4 weeks to monitor resolution
- Normal physical activities can be resumed once all symptoms have resolved but avoid extreme exertion until full resolution
- Patients should be advised to stop smoking as it is an associated factor in recurrence
- Air travel should be avoided until at least 1 week after the CXR shows full resolution
- SCUBA diving should be discouraged permanently
# Decompensated (Tension) Pneumothorax
- Treat immediately with needle decompression of haemithorax:
	- Prepare the skin with antiseptic and infiltrate local anaesthetic to the skin adjacent to periosteum and pleura (if time allows)
	- Insert a 14G IV cannula over the 3rd rib into the 2nd intercostal space in the midclavicular line on the affected side

[^2]: Some sources say can request an expiratory CXR if in doubt, but eTG says it is not recommended because it may exaggerate the size of the pneumothorax
