# Presentation
- Develops over minutes with severe breathlnessness, coughing frothy pink sputum, orthopnoea and PND
- Patient is typically distressed, unable to lie flat and usually peripherally shut down and clammy
- Examination findings include tachypnoea, tachycardia, hypertension with widespread basal crackles and possibly expiratory wheeze ('cardiac asthma')
# Assessment

# Investigations
## Chest-Xray
- Alveolar oedema ('batwing' appearance)
- Kerly B lines (1-2cm horizontal, peripheral engorged subpleural lymphatics) and septal lines
- Cardiomegaly
- Upper love diversion
- Pleural effusion
- Additionally to ABCDE features above; it may show a precipitating cause such as a pneumonia

^cxr-findings

- Progression
	- Interstitial pulmonary oedema develops first
	- Peribronchial cuffing
	- Thickening of interlobar fissures
	- Bat wing oedema is alveolar oedema in a non-gravity-dependent distribution; usually seen in hyper-acute heart failure (e.g. acute mitral incompetence due to papillary muscle rupture)

## Point of Care Ultrasound[^1]
![[Pasted image 20251028203758.png]]
- B lines seen on lung ultrasound
	- The presence of â‰¥3 B-lines per rib space suggests the presence of interstitial pulmonary fluid
- Consider POCUS in patients with undifferentiated respiratory distress
- POCUS may identify a ruptured valve causing acute pulmonary oedema and escalate the need for cardiothoracic intervention
# Management
Can remember as LMNOP (backwards)
- **P**osition the patient upright
- Give high-flow **o**xygen via a reservoir mask aiming for oxygen saturation >95%
	- There is limited evidence that demonstrates BPAP as advantagous over CPAP
- **N**itrates for patients acutely hypertensive:
	- ==Give GTN 0.3-0.6 mg SL or GTN 0.4mg spray. Repeat after 5 minutes if SBP remains >100 mmHg. Remove the tablet if excessive hypotension occurs (hence tablet preferred)==
	- Commence a GTN infusion IV as per hospital guidelines once the patient is fully monitored preferably in an ICU area; infuse initially at 1mL/h maintaining SBP >100mmHg, quickly increase by doubling the infusion rate every 5 minutes to 20 mL/h or more, titrated to SBP
- **M**orphine or opioid potentially[^2]
	- Titrate IV morphine in small boluses 1.25-2.5mg for chest pain and anxiety but take care not to depress respirations
- In patients with evidence of systemic fluid overload, give frusemide (**L**asix) 40mg IV or twice the usual daily dose IV (if already on frusemide)
	- Many patients with APO have volume redistribution as opposed to fluid overload
- If unresponsive to above measures
	- Commence mask CPAP ventilation if the patient does not respond quickly to above measures, remains distressed or is persistently hypoxic despite maximal oxygen delivery
	- Use a dedicated, high-flow oxygen circuit and a tight-fitting mask with initial PEEP reisistance of 5-10cm $\ce{H2O}$
	- A trained nurse must remain in attendance at all times as some patients will not tolerate the mask
	- Once the patient improves wean the inspired oxygen concentration and PEEP until the patient is comfortable with a normal oxygen mask
	- If the patient is hypotensive with poor peripheral perfusion, call senior and intensive care ([[MET Activation Criteria]]) and treat as for cardiogenic [[Shock]]; ET intubation usually required
- Other measures to remember:
	- Continue oxygen therapy
	- Obtain IV access
	- Telemetry and other monitoring (blood pressure and pulse oximetry)
	- Consider inserting a catheter to monitor urine output
- Also consider:
	- Glyceryl trinitrate infusion 10mcg/min; increase by doubling the infusion rate every 5 minutes according to clinical response and maintaining systolic blood pressure at more than 90 mmHg
	- Non-invasive ventilation with 100% oxygen: CPAP, starting with 10cm of water pressure
		- If difficulty tolerating non-invasive ventilation can consider morphine 1 to 2.5mg intravenously
	- If atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular rate is contributing to poor cardiac output use: amiodarone 300mg by intravenous infusion over 30-60 minutes
	- If pulmonary oedema is not responding to the above measures (especially if hypotensive or poorly perfused) consider adding dobutamine 2.5 to 15 mcg/kg/minute by intravenous infusion
## Determine precipitating cause for the acute episode
- Six major aetiologies:
	- Ischaemic heart disease
	- Hypertension
	- Valvular disease (mitral incompetence, aortic stenosis)
	- Cardiomyopathy (dilated, restrictive, hypertrophic) including congenital heart disease
	- Pericardial disease
	- [[Pulmonary Embolism|PE]]
- The most common precipitating factors include:
	- [[Acute Coronary Syndromes]]
	- Arrhythmia
	- Fever, infection
	- [[Pulmonary Embolism|PE]]
	- Increased sodium or fluid load (parenteral, medicinal, dietary)
	- Cardiac depressant drug (e.g. beta-blockers, calcium-channel blockers)
	- Sodium-retaining agents (e.g. NSAIDs)
	- Renal disease
	- Anaemia
	- Non-compliance with diet or medication (e.g. dialysis patient)
