# Presentation
- Develops over minutes with severe breathlnessness, coughing frothy pink sputum, orthopnoea and PND
- Patient is typically distressed, unable to lie flat and usually peripherally shut down and clammy
- Examination findings include tachypnoea, tachycardia with widespread basal crackles and possibly expiratory wheeze ('cardiac asthma')

# Aetiologies

| Cardiogenic                                                                                                     | Non-Cardiogenic                                                                                                |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Excessive LV afterload (i.e. SCAPE)<br>(e.g. severe hypertension, aortic stenosis, HOCM)                        | Increased capillary permeability (e.g. ARDS, reperfusion following relief of embolic occlusion, near drowning) |
| Excessive LV preload (e.g. fluid overload, rapid fluid bolus)                                                   | Neurogenic pulmonary oedema                                                                                    |
| Excessive left atrial afterload (e.g. mitral stenosis, mitral thrombosis, mitral valve prolapse, atrial myxoma) | Drug-induced pulmonary oedema (e.g. opiate induced, salicylate overdose)                                       |
| Poor contractility (e.g. cardiomyopathy, drug effect (e.g. beta-blockers), metabolic disease, myocarditis)      | Raised pulmonary arterial pressure (e.g. massive PE, pulmonary veno-occlusive disease, air embolism)           |
| Ineffective contractility (e.g. mitral regurgitation, Takotsubo cardiomyopathy)                                 | Negative pressure pulmonary oedema (e.g. airway obstruction, after drainage of a large pleural effusion)       |

# Investigations
## Chest-Xray
- Alveolar oedema ('batwing' appearance)
- Kerly B lines (1-2cm horizontal, peripheral engorged subpleural lymphatics) and septal lines
- Cardiomegaly
- Upper love diversion
- Pleural effusion
- Additionally to ABCDE features above; it may show a precipitating cause such as a pneumonia

^cxr-findings

- Progression
	- Interstitial pulmonary oedema develops first
	- Peribronchial cuffing
	- Thickening of interlobar fissures
	- Bat wing oedema is alveolar oedema in a non-gravity-dependent distribution; usually seen in hyper-acute heart failure (e.g. acute mitral incompetence due to papillary muscle rupture)

## Point of Care Ultrasound[^1]
![[Pasted image 20251028203758.png|300]]![[Pasted image 20251109172142.png|300]]
- B lines seen on lung ultrasound
	- The presence of ≥3 B-lines per rib space suggests the presence of interstitial pulmonary fluid
	- Cardiogenic pulmonary oedema generates a pattern of diffuse B-lines throughout the chest with thin pleural interfaces
	- Non-cardiogenic pulmonary oedema shows a patchy distribution of B-lines anda. thickened pleural interface
- Consider POCUS in patients with undifferentiated respiratory distress
- POCUS may identify a ruptured valve causing acute pulmonary oedema and escalate the need for cardiothoracic intervention
- Cardiac ultrasonagraphy should generally reveal some evidence of heart failure for example:
	- Systolic heart failure with reduced left ventricular ejection fraction
	- Diastolic heart failure may be suggested by left ventricular hypertrophy and a dilated left atrium
# Management
- Can remember as LMNOP (backwards) at a junior level but better to approach from n ABC perspective when critically unwell.
## Treat Ventilation and Lungs
- **P**osition the patient upright
- Give high-flow **o**xygen via a reservoir mask aiming for oxygen saturation >95%
- If unresponsive to above measures
	- Commence mask CPAP ventilation if the patient does not respond quickly to above measures, remains distressed or is persistently hypoxic despite maximal oxygen delivery
	- Use a dedicated, high-flow oxygen circuit and a tight-fitting mask with initial PEEP reisistance of 5-10cm $\ce{H2O}$
	- A trained nurse must remain in attendance at all times as some patients will not tolerate the mask
	- Once the patient improves wean the inspired oxygen concentration and PEEP until the patient is comfortable with a normal oxygen mask
	- If the patient is hypotensive with poor peripheral perfusion, call senior and intensive care ([[MET Activation Criteria]]) and treat as for cardiogenic [[Shock]]; ET intubation usually required
		- When in doubt about need for intubation: start BiPAP and optimise other factors as rapidly as possible and re-evaluate trajectory and need for BiPAP
- Consider therapeutic drainage of a large pleural effusion; doesn't fix the heart failure but temporally stabilises respiratory function
## Optimise MAP
- **N**itrates for patients acutely hypertensive:
	- ==Give GTN 0.3-0.6 mg SL or GTN 0.4mg spray. Repeat after 5 minutes if SBP remains >100 mmHg. Remove the tablet if excessive hypotension occurs (hence tablet preferred)==
	- increase cycling of NIBP
	- Commence a GTN infusion IV as per hospital guidelines once the patient is fully monitored preferably in an ICU area; infuse initially at 1mL/h maintaining SBP >100mmHg, quickly increase by doubling the infusion rate every 5 minutes to 20 mL/h or more, titrated to SBP
- **M**orphine or opioid potentially[^2]
	- Titrate IV morphine in small boluses 1.25-2.5mg for chest pain and anxiety but take care not to depress respirations
- In patients with evidence of systemic fluid overload, give frusemide (**L**asix) 40mg IV or twice the usual daily dose IV (if already on frusemide)
	- Many patients with APO have volume redistribution as opposed to fluid overload
- Other measures to remember:
	- Continue oxygen therapy
	- Obtain IV access
	- Telemetry and other monitoring (blood pressure and pulse oximetry)
	- Consider inserting a catheter to monitor urine output
- Also consider:
	- Glyceryl trinitrate infusion 10mcg/min; increase by doubling the infusion rate every 5 minutes according to clinical response and maintaining systolic blood pressure at more than 90 mmHg
	- Non-invasive ventilation with 100% oxygen: CPAP, starting with 10cm of water pressure
		- If difficulty tolerating non-invasive ventilation can consider morphine 1 to 2.5mg intravenously
	- If atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular rate is contributing to poor cardiac output use: amiodarone 300mg by intravenous infusion over 30-60 minutes
	- If pulmonary oedema is not responding to the above measures (especially if hypotensive or poorly perfused) consider adding dobutamine 2.5 to 15 mcg/kg/minute by intravenous infusion
## Determine precipitating cause for the acute episode
- Six major aetiologies:
	- Ischaemic heart disease
	- Hypertension
	- Valvular disease (mitral incompetence, aortic stenosis)
	- Cardiomyopathy (dilated, restrictive, hypertrophic) including congenital heart disease
	- Pericardial disease
	- [[Pulmonary Embolism|PE]]
- The most common precipitating factors include:
	- [[Acute Coronary Syndromes]]
	- Arrhythmia
	- Fever, infection
	- [[Pulmonary Embolism|PE]]
	- Increased sodium or fluid load (parenteral, medicinal, dietary)
	- Cardiac depressant drug (e.g. beta-blockers, calcium-channel blockers)
	- Sodium-retaining agents (e.g. NSAIDs)
	- Renal disease
	- Anaemia
	- Non-compliance with diet or medication (e.g. dialysis patient)
