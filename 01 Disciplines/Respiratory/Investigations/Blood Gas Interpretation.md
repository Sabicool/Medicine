# Useful information
- With respiratory problems, PCO2 and pH change in different directions
- With metabolic problems, PCO2 and pH change in the same direction

# Introduction
- Make sure you understand the difference between oxygenation and ventilation
- Have a good understanding of [[Acute Respiratory Failure]]
# Approach
1. $P\rm{a}\ce{O2}$: Determine the adequacy of oxygenation (80-100 mmHg)
2. Determine pH status (7.35-7.45)
	- pH <7.35: Acidosis is an abnormal process that increases the serum hydrogen ion concentration, lowers the pH and results in acidaemia
	 - pH >7.45: Alkalosis is an abnormal process that decreases the hydrogen ion concentration and results in alkalaemia
1. $P\rm{a}\ce{CO2}$: Determine the respiratory component (35-45 mmHg)
	  - $P\rm{a}\ce{CO2}$ <35 ⇒ ↑ respiratory rate
		+ If pH >7.45: primary respiratory alkalosis (especially if $\ce{HCO3-}$ normal)
		+ If pH <7.35 and ↓ $\ce{HCO3-}$: respiratory compensation for metabolic acidosis
	- $P\rm{a}\ce{CO2}$ >45 ⇒ ↓ respiratory rate
	     + If pH <7.35 and $\ce{HCO3-}$ normal: hypoventilation
	     + If pH >7.45 and ↑ $\ce{HCO3-}$: respiratory compensation for metabolic alkalosis
1. $\ce{HCO3-}$: Determine the metabolic component (22-26 mmol/L)
	- $\ce{HCO3-}$<22
		- If pH <7.35: primary metabolic acidosis
		- If pH >7.45: renal compensation for respiratory alkalosis
	- $\ce{HCO3-}$ >26
		- If pH >7.45: primary metabolic alkalaosis
		- If pH <7.35: renal compensation for respiratory acidosis

# 12345 Rule
- Respiratory acidosis :: For every 10 mmHg rise in PaCO2, there should be 1 increase in $\ce{HCO3-}$ for acute and 4 increase in chronic
- Respiratory alkalosis :: For every 10mmHg rise in PaCO2, there should be 2 decrease in $\ce{HCO3-}$ for acute and 5 decrease in chronic

# Anion Gap
- Given by the formula:
$$
\rm{Anion\; Gap}=\ce{Na+ - (Cl- + HCO3^-)}
$$
- The normal value varies between machine and technique used (4-12 if measured by ion selective electrode or 8-16 if measured by flame photometry)
- If AG >30 mmol/L then metabolic acidosis is invariably present
- Importantly albumin is the major unmeasured anion and contributes most to the anion gap value, so in hypoalbuminaemia patients may appear as a normal anion gap acidosis but actually have a high anion gap acidosis
- High anion gap metabolic acidosis :: Accumulation of organic acids or impaired $\ce{H+}$ excretion
- Normal anion gap metabolic acidosis :: Loss of $\ce{HCO3-}$ from ECF
