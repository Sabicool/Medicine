- Type 1: Hypoxaemia with normal (or low) Pa$\ce{CO2}$
	- Primarily a failure of oxygenation
	- Usually responds to oxygen therapy
- Type 2: Hypoxaemia with an increased Pa$\ce{CO2}$
	- Failure of ventilation and oxygenation
	- Requires ventilatory assistance as well as supplemental oxygen
- ABG results of P$\ce{O2}$ <60mmHg or P$\ce{CO2}$ >50mmHg with an associated pH <7.30 is suggestive of acute respiratory failure
