- Type 1: Hypoxaemia with normal (or low) Pa$\ce{CO2}$
	- Primarily a failure of oxygenation
	- Usually responds to oxygen therapy
- Type 2: Hypoxaemia with an increased Pa$\ce{CO2}$
	- Failure of ventilation and oxygenation
	- Requires ventilatory assistance as well as supplemental oxygen
- ABG results of P$\ce{O2}$ <60mmHg or P$\ce{CO2}$ >50mmHg with an associated pH <7.30 is suggestive of acute respiratory failure
# Causes
- [Acute obstruction](01%20Disciplines/Clinical/Emergencies/Acute%20Airway%20Failure.md)
- Pulmonary
	- Bronchosapsm with wheeze (e.g. [Asthma](01%20Disciplines/Respiratory/Conditions/Asthma.md), [COPD](01%20Disciplines/Respiratory/Conditions/COPD.md), [anaphylaxis](01%20Disciplines/Immunology/Emergencies/Anaphylaxis.md))
	- [Pneumothorax](01%20Disciplines/Respiratory/Conditions/Pneumothorax.md)
	- Massive pleural effusion
	- Interstitial lung disease
	- [Pulmonary Hypertension](01%20Disciplines/Cardiology/Conditions/Pulmonary%20Hypertension.md)
- Cardiovascular
	- [Acute Pulmonary Oedema](01%20Disciplines/Respiratory/Conditions/Acute%20Pulmonary%20Oedema.md)
	- [Pulmonary Embolism](01%20Disciplines/Respiratory/Conditions/Pulmonary%20Embolism.md)
- Neuromuscular
	- Depressed level of consciousness
	- Muscular weakness (Guillain-Barré syndrome, myaesthenia gravis, muscular dystrophy)
	- Drug intoxication (opioid, sedative)
	- Poisoning (carbon monoxide, opioid)
# Overview of Assessment and Management
1. Always call for help
2. Give oxygen
3. Assess the patient
4. CXR/ABG/VBG
5. Consider adjuncts
6. Escalation of care
# Assessment
- Can remember as RATES (respiratory rate, auscultate, trachea position, effort of breathing and saturation)
- Airway Patency![[Acute Airway Failure#^airway-assessment]]
- Work of breathing
	- Signs include: ↑ RR, use of accessory muscles, soft-tissue recession, ↑ HR, sweaty/clammy skin
- Effectiveness of respiratory function (saturation probe)
	- Hypoxia
		- Cyanosis (oxygen saturation <88%)
		- Cardiac ischaemia or arrhythmias
		- Acidosis from tissue hypoxia (lactic acidosis)
		- Anxiety, agitation or depressed consciousness
		- ↑ A-a gradient on ABG
	- Hypoventilation
		- Vasodilation
		- Headache, drowsiness and lethargy
		- Asterixis
		- Acidosis - respiratory acidosis (inadequate removal of $\ce{CO2}$)
- Respiratory decompensation
	- Decompensation is when severe or prolonged respiratory insult causes exhaustion or a reduction in the patient's physiological reserves
	- Signs of decompensation
		- Gasping
		- ↓ respiratory effort
		- Sweating, lethargy, apathy, drowsiness and coma
		- Tachycardia → bradycardia (preterminal sign)
		- Respiratory arrest followed by cardiac arrest
	- If a patient has any features of decompensation, *call senior staff or a [MET call](00%20Reference/Clinical/MET%20Activation%20Criteria.md) immediately*
- Diagnose the cause
	- Common conditions which can progress to respiratory failure:
		- [Pneumonia](01%20Disciplines/Respiratory/Conditions/Pneumonia.md)
		- [Exacerbation of COPD](01%20Disciplines/Respiratory/Conditions/COPD.md#Exacerbation-of-COPD)
		- [Acute Pulmonary Oedema](01%20Disciplines/Respiratory/Conditions/Acute%20Pulmonary%20Oedema.md)
		- [Asthma](01%20Disciplines/Respiratory/Conditions/Asthma.md) (Pa$\ce{CO2}$ rises very late)
		- [Pulmonary Embolism](01%20Disciplines/Respiratory/Conditions/Pulmonary%20Embolism.md)
		- [Pneumothorax](01%20Disciplines/Respiratory/Conditions/Pneumothorax.md)
# Investigations
- Investigations to consider
	- ECG
	- ABG/VBG
	- [[Lung POCUS]]
	- CXR
	- TTE
	- CTPA
# Management
- Use supplemental oxygen in all hypoxic patients with high-flow oxygen at 15 L/min through a mask with a reservoir
	- High inspired oxygen concentrations do not depress ventilation in patients who are in respiratory distress
	- In patients with COPD who chronically retain $\ce{CO2}$ titrate use of a venturi mask
		- Giving too much oxygen to patients who chronically retain $\ce{CO2}$ causes a rise in Pa$\ce{CO2}$ because:
			- Changes in pulmonary vasoconstriction, dead space and shunting (V/Q mistmatch)
			- Haldane effect (haemoglobin molecules release $\ce{CO2}$ in the presence of oxygen)
			- Blunting of the hypoxic drive; these patients depend on mild hypoxia to stimulate their respiratory centre
		- If unsure if they are a chronic retainer, check any previous blood gas results
		- Begin impirical $\ce{O2}$ treatment under pulse oximetry monitoring
		- Increase/decrease oxygen delivery until $\ce{O2}$ saturation is 88-92% by using different oxygen mixers in a venturi mask or changing the flow rate in a simple mask
		- Recheck blood gases and watch for a change in $P\ce{CO2}$:
			- Continue with current therapy if $\ce{CO2}$ is normalising
			- Decrease oxygen deliver if $\ce{CO2}$ is increasing but maintain $\ce{O2}$ saturation of 88-92%
				- If $\ce{CO2}$ is increasing and you are unable to maintain oxygen saturation >88%, the patient requires assisted ventilation (BiPAP) *see ventilation below*
- Blood gases are necessary to determine the adequacy of ventilation (can use either venous or arterial as it will likely not influence immediate management)
- Consider bronchodilators (see: [[COPD#Exacerbation of COPD|COPD Exacerbation]])
- Consider reversing opiates
## Ventilation
- Ensure the patient has not received respiratory depressants (e.g. opioids) in the past 24 hours (e.g. check pupils)
	- Give ==naloxone 0.2mg up to 2mg IV, SC or IM every 5 minutes== repeated until alert
		- Be careful to avoid a withdrawal reaction: Start at 100 mcg IV in opiate-dependent patients
- Bag valve mask assisted manual ventilation may be required in a patient with ↓ LOC until definitive ventilation is available
	- Consider: CPAP, BiPAP ventilation or NIV machines
- If still no improvement contact ICU and make arrangements for ETT intubation
- ==Acute respiratory acidosis with a pH <7.2 usually requires mechanical ventilation until the precipitating cause can be reversed==
