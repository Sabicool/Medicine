- Type 1: Hypoxaemia with normal (or low) Pa$\ce{CO2}$
	- Primarily a failure of oxygenation
	- Usually responds to oxygen therapy
- Type 2: Hypoxaemia with an increased Pa$\ce{CO2}$
	- Failure of ventilation and oxygenation
	- Requires ventilatory assistance as well as supplemental oxygen
- ABG results of P$\ce{O2}$ <60mmHg or P$\ce{CO2}$ >50mmHg with an associated pH <7.30 is suggestive of acute respiratory failure
# Causes
- [Acute obstruction](01%20Disciplines/Clinical/Emergencies/Acute%20Airway%20Failure.md)
- Pulmonary
	- Bronchosapsm with wheeze (e.g. [Asthma](01%20Disciplines/Respiratory/Conditions/Asthma.md), [COPD](01%20Disciplines/Respiratory/Conditions/COPD.md), [anaphylaxis](01%20Disciplines/Immunology/Emergencies/Anaphylaxis.md))
	- [Pneumothorax](01%20Disciplines/Respiratory/Conditions/Pneumothorax.md)
	- Massive pleural effusion
	- Interstitial lung disease
	- [Pulmonary Hypertension](01%20Disciplines/Cardiology/Conditions/Pulmonary%20Hypertension.md)
- Cardiovascular
	- [Acute Pulmonary Oedema](Acute%20Pulmonary%20Oedema)
	- [Pulmonary Embolism](Pulmonary%20Embolism)
- Neuromuscular
	- Depressed level of consciousness
	- Muscular weakness (Guillain-Barré syndrome, myaesthenia gravis, muscular dystrophy)
	- Drug intoxication (opioid, sedative)
	- Poisoning (carbon monoxide, opioid)
# Assessment
- Work of breathing
	- Signs include: ↑ RR, use of accessory muscles, soft-tissue recession, ↑ HR, sweaty/clammy skin
- Effectiveness of respiratory function
	- Hypoxia
