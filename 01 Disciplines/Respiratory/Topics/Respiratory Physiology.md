# Oxygen Transport
- Oxygen is carried within the circulation bound to Hb (98%) and dissolved in plasma (2%)
$$
\begin{align*}
\ce{O2}\ \text{content per}\ 100\ \text{mL of blood}&=\underbrace{\underset{\text{Hüfner's constant}}{1.34}\times\ce{[Hb]}\times\frac{S_\text{a}\ce{O2}}{100\%}}_{\ce{O2}\ \text{bound to haemoglobin}}+\underbrace{\underset{\text{Solubility constant}}{0.023}\times P_\text{a}\ce{O2}}_{\ce{O2}\ \text{dissolved in blood}}\\
&\approx19.8\ \text{mL for typical arterial blood}
\end{align*}
$$
- Very little $\ce{O2}$ is stored in the body ⇒ apnoea rapidly leads to hypoxia
## Red Blood Cells
- Do not contain a nucleus or mitochondria ⇒ entirely dependent on glucose and the glycolytic pathway for energy
## Haemoglobin
- HbA has two $\alpha$-chains and two $\beta$-chains each of which have an iron-containing porphyring ring with iron in the ferrous state ($\ce{Fe^2+}$)
![[Pasted image 20260125210015.png]]
- Haemoglobin has a preference to be either fully saturated or desaturated due to cooperativity
	- Cooperative binding is the increase in $\ce{O2}$ affinity of Hb with each successive $\ce{O2}$ binding
- Rightward shift (↑ offloading) of the oxyhaemoglobin dissociation curve is caused by (mnemonic: CADETS):
	- Increased $P\ce{CO2}$
	- Acidosis
	- Increased 2,3-dihosphoglycerate
	- Exercise
	- Increased temperature
	- The presence of sickle haemoglobin (HbS) in sickle cell disease

### Types of Hb
- Physiological
	- $\ce{HbA}$: normal most common form ($\ce{\alpha 2\beta 2}$)
	- $\ce{HbA2}$: other adult form accounting for 2-3% ($\ce{\alpha 2\delta 2}$)
	- $\ce{HbF}$: normal variant during feotal life and has a higher affinity for $\ce{O2}$ ($\ce{\alpha 2\gamma 2}$)
- Pathological
	- $\ce{HbS}$: in sickle cell disease which has an abnormal $\beta$-globin subunit
	- $\ce{MetHb}$: Methaemoglobinaemia is where the ferrous iron within the Hb molecule is oxidised to ferric iron ($\ce{Fe^3+}$); $\ce{Fe^3+}$ cannot bind to $\ce{O2}$, so $\ce{MetHb}$ cannot participate in $\ce{O2}$ transport
		- Low level of $\ce{MetHb}$ is maintained by:
			- Glutathione/nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) system where oxidising agents are reduced by glutathione before being able to oxidise ferrous iron; the pentose phosphate pathway is integral for this as it supplies NADPH to return glutathione back to its reduced form
			- $\ce{MetHb}$ reductase/nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) system reduces ferric iron by a reduction system involving $\ce{MetHb}$ reductase
		- Methaemoglobinaemia occurs as a result of:
			- Oxidising agents overwhelming the glutathione system (e.g. suphonamide antibiotics, nitric oxide and prilocaine)
			- Failure of protective reduction systems (e.g. G6PD deficiency)
		- Pulse oximeters misread $\ce{MetHb}$ and display values of 85% irrespective of $\ce{MetHb}$ concentration
		- Manage with supplemental oxygen in mild cases and methylene blue in severe cases
	- $\ce{COHb}$: Formed when $\ce{Hb}$ binds inhaled carbon monoxide molecules
	- $\ce{CyanoHb}$: Cyanohaemoglobin is formed when $\ce{Hb}$ is exposed to cyanide ions
