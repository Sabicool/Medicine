# Oxygen Transport
- Oxygen is carried within the circulation bound to Hb (98%) and dissolved in plasma (2%)
$$
\begin{align*}
\ce{O2}\ \text{content per}\ 100\ \text{mL of blood}&=\underbrace{\underset{\text{Hüfner's constant}}{1.34}\times\ce{[Hb]}\times\frac{S_\text{a}\ce{O2}}{100\%}}_{\ce{O2}\ \text{bound to haemoglobin}}+\underbrace{\underset{\text{Solubility constant}}{0.023}\times P_\text{a}\ce{O2}}_{\ce{O2}\ \text{dissolved in blood}}\\
&\approx19.8\ \text{mL for typical arterial blood}
\end{align*}
$$
- Very little $\ce{O2}$ is stored in the body ⇒ apnoea rapidly leads to hypoxia
## Red Blood Cells
- Do not contain a nucleus or mitochondria ⇒ entirely dependent on glucose and the glycolytic pathway for energy
## Haemoglobin
- HbA has two $\alpha$-chains and two $\beta$-chains each of which have an iron-containing porphyring ring with iron in the ferrous state ($\ce{Fe^2+}$)
![[Pasted image 20260125210015.png]]
- Haemoglobin has a preference to be either fully saturated or desaturated due to cooperativity
	- Cooperative binding is the increase in $\ce{O2}$ affinity of Hb with each successive $\ce{O2}$ binding
- Rightward shift (↑ offloading) of the oxyhaemoglobin dissociation curve is caused by (mnemonic: CADETS):
	- Increased $P\ce{CO2}$
	- Acidosis
	- Increased 2,3-dihosphoglycerate
	- Exercise
	- Increased temperature
	- The presence of sickle haemoglobin (HbS) in sickle cell disease

### Types of Hb
- Physiological
	- $\ce{HbA}$: normal most common form ($\ce{\alpha 2\beta 2}$)
	- $\ce{HbA2}$: other adult form accounting for 2-3% ($\ce{\alpha 2\delta 2}$)
	- $\ce{HbF}$: normal variant during feotal life and has a higher affinity for $\ce{O2}$ ($\ce{\alpha 2\gamma 2}$)
- Pathological
	- $\ce{HbS}$: in sickle cell disease which has an abnormal $\beta$-globin subunit
	- $\ce{MetHb}$: Methaemoglobinaemia is where the ferrous iron within the Hb molecule is oxidised to ferric iron ($\ce{Fe^3+}$); $\ce{Fe^3+}$ cannot bind to $\ce{O2}$, so $\ce{MetHb}$ cannot participate in $\ce{O2}$ transport
		- Low level of $\ce{MetHb}$ is maintained by:
			- Glutathione/nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) system where oxidising agents are reduced by glutathione before being able to oxidise ferrous iron; the pentose phosphate pathway is integral for this as it supplies NADPH to return glutathione back to its reduced form
			- $\ce{MetHb}$ reductase/nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) system reduces ferric iron by a reduction system involving $\ce{MetHb}$ reductase
		- Methaemoglobinaemia occurs as a result of:
			- Oxidising agents overwhelming the glutathione system (e.g. suphonamide antibiotics, nitric oxide and prilocaine)
			- Failure of protective reduction systems (e.g. G6PD deficiency)
		- Pulse oximeters misread $\ce{MetHb}$ and display values of 85% irrespective of $\ce{MetHb}$ concentration
		- Manage with supplemental oxygen in mild cases and methylene blue in severe cases
	- $\ce{COHb}$: Formed when $\ce{Hb}$ binds inhaled carbon monoxide molecules
	- $\ce{CyanoHb}$: Cyanohaemoglobin is formed when $\ce{Hb}$ is exposed to cyanide ions
# Carbon Dioxide Transport
- A typical adult produces $\ce{CO2}$ at a basal rate of 200mL/min; during exercise it can increase as high as 4000 mL/min
- $\ce{CO2}$ is transported in circulation in three forms
	- Dissolved in plasma
	- Bound to Hb and other proteins as carbamino compounds
		- When $\ce{CO2}$ reacts with a terminal amine group within the Hb molecule forming carbaminohaemoglobin
		- Deoxyhaemoglobin forms carbamino compounds more readily than oxyhaemoglobin
	- Bicarbonate
		- Carbonic anhydrase catalyses the reaction to form bicarbonic acid
			- The cytoplasm of red blood cells contains carbonic anhydrase, but plasma does not contain carbonic anhydrase therefore it can only occur within the RBC
			- Almost all $\ce{H2CO3}$ dissociates into $\ce{HCO3-}$ and $\ce{H+}$
			- $\ce{CO2}$ and water can diffuse directly through the RBC membrane whilst $\ce{H+}$ and $\ce{HCO3-}$ cannot; forward direction of the reaction is maintained by preventing the build up $\ce{HCO3-}$ and $\ce{H+}$ via two processes:
				- Chloride shift (Hamburger effect): $\ce{HCO3-}$ is transported across teh RBC membrane down its electrochemical gradient by the $\ce{Cl-}$/$\ce{HCO3-}$ exchanger
				- Binding of $\ce{H+}$ to histidine side chains of the haemoglobin molecule reducing intracellular concentration of $\ce{H+}$
$$
\ce{CO2 + H2O <=>[CA] H2CO3 <=> H+ + HCO3-}

## Haldane Effect
- Describes the observation that deoxyhaemoglobin is more effective net carrier of $\ce{CO2}$ than oxyhaemoglobin
- This is because of two reasons:
	- Deoxyhaemoglobin more readily forms carbamino compounds
	- Deoxyhaemoglobin is a stronger base than oxyhaemoglobin and more readily accepts $\ce{H+}$ allowing rightward shift of the above equilibrium (increasing $\ce{HCO3-}$ formation)
- Metabolically active tissues produce $\ce{H+}$ and $\ce{CO2}$. Through the Bohr effect and its effect on $P_{50}$, additional $\ce{O2}$ is offloaded to the most metabolically active tissues
	- According to the Haldane effect, the newly formed deoxyhaemoglobin is better at binding $\ce{H+}$ and carrying $\ce{CO2}$ than is oxyhaemoglobin 
	- The metabolic waste products are therefore efficiently transported away from the tissues to the lungs
## Carbon Dioxide Dissociation Curve
- Describes the relationship between partial pressure of $\ce{CO2}$ ($P\ce{CO2}$) and the blood $\ce{CO2}$ content
- Typical $P_\text{a}\ce{CO2}$ is 5.3 kPa (~39.8 mmHg) and results in a $\ce{CO2}$ content of about 48 mL/100 mL
- Typical $P_\text{v}\ce{CO2}$ is 6.1 kPa (~45.8 mmHg) and results in a $\ce{CO2}$ content of about 52 mL/100 mL
- At physiological $P\ce{CO2}$, the $\ce{CO2}$ dissociation curve is essentially linear
- Often drawn as two curves representing arterial and venous blood

> [!NOTE] Importance of Pre-Oxygenation During Intubation
>  In total, the circulation and lungs contain approximately 2.5 L of immediately available $\ce{CO2}$ and 1550 mL of $\ce{O2}$. If a healthy patient stops breathing (e.g. on induction of general anaesthesia), basal processes will continue: 250 mL/min of $\ce{O2}$ will be consumed and 200 mL/min of $\ce{CO2}$ will be produced. Therefore:  $P\ce{CO2}$ will increase by 0.4–0.8 kPa/min. $P\ce{O2}$ will fall. The rate of fall is complicated, involving factors such as Hb concentration and total blood volume. Typically, $S_\text{a}\ce{O2}$ falls to 70% ($P\ce{O2}$ 5.0 kPa) after 2 min.  However, if the patient breathes $\ce{O2}$ for sufficient time to completely de-nitrogenate their functional residual capacity prior to the period of apnoea, the quantity of stored $\ce{O2}$ increases to over 3 L – even after 5 min of apnoea, $S_\text{a}\ce{O2}$ will remain at 100%. Basal metabolic processes will continue and after 5 min the $P_\text{a}\ce{CO2}$ will approach 10 kPa.
