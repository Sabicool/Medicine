# Upper Airways
## Pharynx
- Pharyngeal constrictors (inferior, middle and superior) allow for swalloing
- Pharyngeal dilators contract to maintain patency of the pharynx so that air can flow to the lungs
- During inspiration negative pressure may cause the pharynx to collapse if it were not for the pharyngeal dilators:
	- Genioglossus which causes the tongue to protrude forward and away from the pharyngeal wall
	- Palatal muscles control the stiffness and position of the palate, tongue and pharynx as well as the shape of the uvula
	- Muscles influencing the position of the hyoid (e.g. geniohyoid) exhibit phasic activity (i.e. their activity is increased during inspiration)
	- While asleep (espeically during stage 3 non-rapid eye movement sleep) there is a loss in pharyngeal muscle tone which can precipitate snoring and obstructive sleep apnoea
	- Apart from ketamine, all the other anaesthetic and sedative agents reduce central respiratory drive and pharyngeal muscle tone
# Lower Airways
## Larynx
- During exhalation, the vocal cords are adducted slightly to create resistance to flow ⇒ positive end expiratory pressure of 3-4cm$\ce{H2O}$ (physiological PEEP) ⇒ prevents alveolar collapse and maintains functional residual capacity
	- During intubation, patients can no longer adduct their vocal cords and can’t maintain physiological PEEP ⇒ atelactasis and $\dot{V}/\dot{Q}$ mismatch; it is therefore common to apply extrinsic PEEP ($\text{PEEP}_\text{e}$) at physiologic levels (3-5 cm$\ce{H2O}$) to maintain FRC and prevent atelactasis following intubation
		- PEEP can increase intrathoracic pressure ⇒ ↓ venous return ↑ venous pressure which may not be favourable in raised ICP or tonsillectomy (increase bleeding at tonsillar bed can obstruct surgeon’s view)
## Tracheobronchial Tree
- Trachea starts at lower border of cricoid cartilage at the level of C6 and bifurcates at the carina (T4/5 level)
- The right main bronchus is shorter, wider and more vertical than the left (therefore inhaled foreign bodies and ETTs are more likely to enter the right main bronchus)
- The right upper lobe bronchus originates from the right main bronchus only 2 cm distal to the carina. In contrast, the left main bronchus bifurcates 5 cm from the carina
	- Hence left-sided double lumen ETTs are favoured over right sided tubes for one lung ventilation
- Bronchioles
	- First generation that does not contain cartilage
	- Have a layer of smooth muscle that governs bronchodilation and constriction
	- $\beta_2$ agonists and anticholinergics cause bronchodilation
- Alveoli
	- Consist of type 1 pneumocytes (allow for gas exchange, thin cells), type 2 pneumocytes (specialised secretory cells that coat the alveoli with pulmonary surfactant) and alveolar macrophages
## Non Respiratory Functions of the Lung
- Immunological and lung defence
- Metabolic and endocrine
	- Inactivation of noradrenaline, serotonin, prostaglandins, bradykinin and acetylcholine
- Synthesis of surfactant, nitric oxide and heparins
- Synthesis, storage and release of pro-inflammatory mediators including histamine, eicasonoids, endothelin, platelet aggregating factor and adenosine
- Some anaesthetic drugs undergo first pass metabolisation in the lungs (e.g. noradrenaline, lignocaine, fentanyl)
