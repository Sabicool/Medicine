# Upper Airways
## Pharynx
- Pharyngeal constrictors (inferior, middle and superior) allow for swalloing
- Pharyngeal dilators contract to maintain patency of the pharynx so that air can flow to the lungs
- During inspiration negative pressure may cause the pharynx to collapse if it were not for the pharyngeal dilators:
	- Genioglossus which causes the tongue to protrude forward and away from the pharyngeal wall
	- Palatal muscles control the stiffness and position of the palate, tongue and pharynx as well as the shape of the uvula
	- Muscles influencing the position of the hyoid (e.g. geniohyoid) exhibit phasic activity (i.e. their activity is increased during inspiration)
	- While asleep (espeically during stage 3 non-rapid eye movement sleep) there is a loss in pharyngeal muscle tone which can precipitate snoring and obstructive sleep apnoea
	- Apart from ketamine, all the other anaesthetic and sedative agents reduce central respiratory drive and pharyngeal muscle tone
