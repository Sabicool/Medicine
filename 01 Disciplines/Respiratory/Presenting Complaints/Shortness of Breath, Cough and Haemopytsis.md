# Phone Call/Presentation Questions
- Reason for admission
- Is the patient symptomatic:
	- Is the patient cyanosed ⇒ immediate review if so
	- How long has the patient had SOB (i.e. is it sudden ⇒ [Pulmonary Embolism](01%20Disciplines/Respiratory/Conditions/Pulmonary%20Embolism.md) or [Pneumothorax](01%20Disciplines/Respiratory/Conditions/Pneumothorax.md) → immediate review)
	- Associated symptoms: chest pain, cough, fever, stridor, wheeze and facial oedema?
- Other observations
	- Vital signs
- Does the patient have a history of [Heart Failure](01%20Disciplines/Cardiology/Conditions/Heart%20Failure.md) or [Acute Pulmonary Oedema](01%20Disciplines/Respiratory/Conditions/Acute%20Pulmonary%20Oedema.md) or of [Asthma](01%20Disciplines/Respiratory/Conditions/Asthma.md) or [COPD](01%20Disciplines/Respiratory/Conditions/COPD.md)?
- Does the patient have massive haemoptysis ⇒immediate review
## Instructions over the phone
- Ask for measurement of the oxygen saturation by non-invasive pulse oximetry
- Give oxygen by mask to maintain saturation >95%
- Request as high a concentration of $\ce{O2}$ in the short term unless the patient has significant COPD → 28% $\ce{O2}$ by Venturi mask and reassess at the bedside
- Ask the nurse to bring the resuscitation trolley to the bedside, attach an ECG monitor to the patient and gain IV access
- Request ==nebulised salbutamol 5mg (1mL) diluted with 3mL of normal saline if the patient has asthma or wheeze==
- Request ==GTN SL (0.4mg by spray or 0.6mg tablet) if the patient is hypertensive, has chest pain or a history of [Heart Failure](01%20Disciplines/Cardiology/Conditions/Heart%20Failure.md); repeat in 5-10 minutes only if SBP remains >100mmHg==

> [!WARNING] Massive haemoptysis
> Haemoptysis of 100-200mL can cause complete airway flooding and asphyxiation 
 # Assessment
## End of Bed
- Does the patient look short of breath?
- Are they able to speak full sentences?
- Seated upright?
## A → E Assessment
- Is the airway patent?
	- Suspect upper airway obstruction if the patient is making breathing efforts (e.g. tachypnoea, agitation, increased WOB) but has stridor and impaired air entry
	- Upper airway obstruction causes: 
		- Pharyngeal soft-tissue obstruction from loss of airway tone, infection (e.g. croup, epiglottitis), Angio-oedema from anaphylaxis or medications (ACE-i)
		- Food bolus or other foreign material in the posterior pharynx or trachea
		- Burns 
		- Tumour
		- Laryngospasm
- Respiratory rate and pattern?
	- See [Acute Respiratory Failure](01%20Disciplines/Respiratory/Emergencies/Acute%20Respiratory%20Failure.md)
	- RR <10 breaths/min ⇒ central depression of ventilation usually due to intracerebral event, drug toxicity (e.g. opioids) or profound hypercarbia
	- RR >20 breaths/min ⇒ increased work of breathing secondary to hypoxia, acidosis, reflex stimulation or pain
	- Be aware of see-saw movements of the chest cage and abdominal wall; manage as [Acute Respiratory Failure](01%20Disciplines/Respiratory/Emergencies/Acute%20Respiratory%20Failure.md)
	- Look for unequal chest expansion associated with hyperresonance and hyperinflation with tracheal deviation to the opposite side ([Tension Pneumothorax](01%20Disciplines/Respiratory/Conditions/Pneumothorax.md))
- Heart rate?
	- Sinus tachycardia is common but bradycardia from hypoxia is pre-terminal
- Blood pressure?
	- Hypotension may indicate [Pneumothorax](01%20Disciplines/Respiratory/Conditions/Pneumothorax.md), cardiac tamponade, massive [Pulmonary Embolism](01%20Disciplines/Respiratory/Conditions/Pulmonary%20Embolism.md), septic shock, cardiogenic shock or occult haemorrhage
	- Hypertension may be associated with [Acute Pulmonary Oedema](01%20Disciplines/Respiratory/Conditions/Acute%20Pulmonary%20Oedema.md)
- JVP?
	- Raised JVP suggests massive [Pulmonary Embolism](01%20Disciplines/Respiratory/Conditions/Pulmonary%20Embolism.md), cardiogenic shock, tension [Pneumothorax](01%20Disciplines/Respiratory/Conditions/Pneumothorax.md) or cardiac tamponade
- Temperature?
	- Elevated temperature suggests infection
	- Low grade fever also happens in [Pulmonary Embolism](01%20Disciplines/Respiratory/Conditions/Pulmonary%20Embolism.md) (esp. in <35 years old)
### Immediate management of the hypoxic patient
- If the patient is not breathing or is making inadequate breathing efforts → head tilt-chin lift or jaw thrust to open the airway and begin ventilation with a bag-mask device connected to high-dose oxygen
	- Call senior, ICU or anaesthetics immediate (or [MET Activation Criteria](00%20Reference/Clinical/MET%20Activation%20Criteria.md))
	- Ensure airway is clear of foreign material using suction
	- Insert oropharyngeal airway if tolerated by the patient
- Do not interfere if patient is coughing and clearing their airway; see [[Choking]]
- If the patient is making adequate respiratory efforts
	- Deliver enough oxygen:
		- Give 4-15L/min oxygen by mask to keep oxygen saturation >95%
		- Titrating oxygen once stabilised
		- Attach pulse oximetry
- Obtain IV access and take bloods for FBC & UEC and request portable chest X-ray and perform an ECG
- Obtain a VBG or ABG
- Provide urgent interventions for life-threatening causes
	- Tension pneumothorax → needle decompression of the chest if the patient is in extreme respiratory distress or hypotense; wide-bore cannula into the second intercostal space in the mid clavicular line
	- Give ==nebulised salbutamol 5mg diluted in 3mL of normal saline== for wheeze
	- Give ==GTN 0.6mg SL and repeat twice further, provided SBP is >100 mmHg== if chest has crackles and [Acute Pulmonary Oedema](01%20Disciplines/Respiratory/Conditions/Acute%20Pulmonary%20Oedema.md) is suspected
