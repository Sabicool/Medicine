# Phone Call/Presentation Questions
- Reason for admission
- Is the patient symptomatic:
	- Is the patient cyanosed ⇒ immediate review if so
	- How long has the patient had SOB (i.e. is it sudden ⇒ [Pulmonary Embolism](01%20Disciplines/Respiratory/Conditions/Pulmonary%20Embolism.md) or [Pneumothorax](01%20Disciplines/Respiratory/Conditions/Pneumothorax.md) → immediate review)
	- Associated symptoms: chest pain, cough, fever, stridor, wheeze and facial oedema?
- Other observations
	- Vital signs
- Does the patient have a history of [Heart Failure](01%20Disciplines/Cardiology/Conditions/Heart%20Failure.md) or [Acute Pulmonary Oedema](01%20Disciplines/Respiratory/Conditions/Acute%20Pulmonary%20Oedema.md) or of [Asthma](01%20Disciplines/Respiratory/Conditions/Asthma.md) or [COPD](01%20Disciplines/Respiratory/Conditions/COPD.md)?
- Does the patient have massive haemoptysis ⇒immediate review
## Instructions over the phone
- Ask for measurement of the oxygen saturation by non-invasive pulse oximetry
- Give oxygen by mask to maintain saturation >95%
- Request as high a concentration of $\ce{O2}$ in the short term unless the patient has significant COPD → 28% $\ce{O2}$ by Venturi mask and reassess at the bedside
- Ask the nurse to bring the resuscitation trolley to the bedside, attach an ECG monitor to the patient and gain IV access
- Request ==nebulised salbutamol 5mg (1mL) diluted with 3mL of normal saline if the patient has asthma or wheeze==
- Request ==GTN SL (0.4mg by spray or 0.6mg tablet)== if the patient is hypertensive, has chest pain or a history of [Heart Failure](01%20Disciplines/Cardiology/Conditions/Heart%20Failure.md); repeat in 5-10 minutes only if SBP remains >100mmHg

# Assessment
## End of Bed
- Does the patient look short of breath?
- Are they able to speak full sentences?
- Seated upright?
## A → E Assessment
- A
	- Is the airway patent?
		- Suspect upper airway obstruction if the patient is making breathing efforts (e.g. tachypnoea, agitation, increased WOB) but has stridor and impaired air entry
		- Upper airway obstruction causes: 
			- Pharyngeal soft-tissue obstruction from loss of airway tone, infection (e.g. croup, epiglottitis), Angio-oedema from anaphylaxis or medications (ACE-i)
			- Food bolus or other foreign material in the posterior pharynx or trachea
			- Burns 
			- Tumour
			- Laryngospasm
- B
	- Respiratory rate and pattern?
		- See [Acute Respiratory Failure](01%20Disciplines/Respiratory/Emergencies/Acute%20Respiratory%20Failure.md)
		- RR <10 breaths/min ⇒ central depression of ventilation usually due to intracerebral event, drug toxicity (e.g. opioids) or profound hypercarbia
		- RR >20 breaths/min ⇒ increased work of breathing secondary to hypoxia, acidosis, reflex stimulation or pain
		- Be aware of see-saw movements of the chest cage and abdominal wall; manage as [Acute Respiratory Failure](01%20Disciplines/Respiratory/Emergencies/Acute%20Respiratory%20Failure.md)
		- Look for unequal chest expansion associated with hyperresonance and hyperinflation with tracheal deviation to the opposite side ([Tension Pneumothorax](01%20Disciplines/Respiratory/Conditions/Pneumothorax.md))
- C
	- Heart rate?
		- Sinus tachycardia is common but bradycardia from hypoxia is pre-terminal
	- Blood pressure?
		- Hypotension may indicate [Pneumothorax](01%20Disciplines/Respiratory/Conditions/Pneumothorax.md), cardiac tamponade, massive [Pulmonary Embolism](01%20Disciplines/Respiratory/Conditions/Pulmonary%20Embolism.md), septic shock, cardiogenic shock or occult haemorrhage
		- Hypertension may be associated with [Acute Pulmonary Oedema](01%20Disciplines/Respiratory/Conditions/Acute%20Pulmonary%20Oedema.md)
	- JVP?
		- Raised JVP suggests massive [Pulmonary Embolism](01%20Disciplines/Respiratory/Conditions/Pulmonary%20Embolism.md), cardiogenic shock, tension [Pneumothorax](01%20Disciplines/Respiratory/Conditions/Pneumothorax.md) or cardiac tamponade
- D
- E
	- Temperature?
		- Elevated temperature suggests infection
		- Low grade fever also happens in [Pulmonary Embolism](01%20Disciplines/Respiratory/Conditions/Pulmonary%20Embolism.md) (esp. in <35 years old)

| Vitals      | Repeat them                                                                                        |
| HEENT       | Check for central cyanosis                                                                         |
| Resp        | Check for wheeze, crackles, consolidation (bronchial breathing, pneumothorax, or pleural effusion) |
### Immediate management of the hypoxic patient
- If the patient is not breathing or is making inadequate breathing efforts → head tilt-chin lift or jaw thrust to open the airway and begin ventilation with a bag-mask device connected to high-dose oxygen
	- Call senior, ICU or anaesthetics immediate (or [MET Activation Criteria](00%20Reference/Clinical/MET%20Activation%20Criteria.md))
	- Ensure airway is clear of foreign material using suction
	- Insert oropharyngeal airway if tolerated by the patient
- Do not interfere if patient is coughing and clearing their airway; see [[Choking]]
- If the patient is making adequate respiratory efforts
	- Deliver enough oxygen:
		- Give 4-15L/min oxygen by mask to keep oxygen saturation >95%
		- Titrating oxygen once stabilised
		- Attach pulse oximetry
- Obtain IV access and take bloods for FBC & UEC and request portable chest X-ray and perform an ECG
- Obtain a VBG or ABG
- Provide urgent interventions for life-threatening causes
	- Tension pneumothorax → needle decompression of the chest if the patient is in extreme respiratory distress or hypotense; wide-bore cannula into the second intercostal space in the mid clavicular line
	- Give ==nebulised salbutamol 5mg diluted in 3mL of normal saline== for wheeze
	- Give ==GTN 0.6mg SL and repeat twice further, provided SBP is >100 mmHg== if chest has crackles and [Acute Pulmonary Oedema](01%20Disciplines/Respiratory/Conditions/Acute%20Pulmonary%20Oedema.md) is suspected
## Selective History and Chart Review
- Reason for patient admission?
- Was SOB sudden or gradual onset?
	- Sudden ⇒ [Pneumothorax](01%20Disciplines/Respiratory/Conditions/Pneumothorax.md), [Pulmonary Embolism](01%20Disciplines/Respiratory/Conditions/Pulmonary%20Embolism.md) and inhaled foreign body
	- Gradual ⇒ [Pneumonia](01%20Disciplines/Respiratory/Conditions/Pneumonia.md)
	- Orthopnoea or paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnoea ⇒ [LV Heart Failure](01%20Disciplines/Cardiology/Conditions/Heart%20Failure.md)
- Chest pain and character?
	- Central, heavy chest pain radiating to the neck, jaw or arms ⇒ [Acute Coronary Syndromes](01%20Disciplines/Cardiology/Conditions/Acute%20Coronary%20Syndromes.md) or [LV Heart Failure](01%20Disciplines/Cardiology/Conditions/Heart%20Failure.md)
	- Pleuritic chest pain ⇒ [Pneumonia](01%20Disciplines/Respiratory/Conditions/Pneumonia.md), [Pulmonary Embolism](01%20Disciplines/Respiratory/Conditions/Pulmonary%20Embolism.md) or [Pneumothorax](01%20Disciplines/Respiratory/Conditions/Pneumothorax.md)
	- [Pulmonary Embolism](01%20Disciplines/Respiratory/Conditions/Pulmonary%20Embolism.md) is characterised by a sudden onset SOB with non-radiating chest pain which can be a central constant ache or lateral pleuritic pain
- Cough? Sputum?
	- Coloured sputum (green, yellow, brown or blood-streaked) suggests an infective source
	- Blood-stained frothy sputum is usually associated with acute LVF
	- Mucoid sputum, produced on a regular basis, is most commonly associated with chronic bronchitis
	- Dry, persistent cough may be caused by an ACE inhibitor, asthma, sinusitis, postviral syndrome or gastro-oesophageal reflux
- Haemoptysis? Estimated volume?
	- History of malignancy, TB, pulmonary vasculitis or [Pulmonary Hypertension](01%20Disciplines/Cardiology/Conditions/Pulmonary%20Hypertension.md)
	- Haemoptysis in PE is rare as most do not cause pulmonary infarction
- Audible wheeze?
	- Sign of reversible airway obstruction in patients with known history of [Asthma](01%20Disciplines/Respiratory/Conditions/Asthma.md) or [COPD](01%20Disciplines/Respiratory/Conditions/COPD.md)
	- Bronchospasm can also happen in other conditions
- Fever? Chills?
	- Check temperature chart since admission
	- [Pulmonary Embolism](01%20Disciplines/Respiratory/Conditions/Pulmonary%20Embolism.md) and postoperative atelactasis are also associated with low-grade fever
- Recent surgery?
	- All postoperative → ↑ risk of atelactasis w/ or w/o consolidation and/or [Pulmonary Embolism](01%20Disciplines/Respiratory/Conditions/Pulmonary%20Embolism.md)
	- Thoracic surgery → ↑ risk of [Pneumothorax](01%20Disciplines/Respiratory/Conditions/Pneumothorax.md), haemothoracic and cardiac tamponade
	- Pain after surgery ↑ risk of atelactasis
	- Abdominal distension → ↓ ventilation and ↑ dyspnoea
- Mobilisation (especially if post-op)
- Prior status (e.g. previously independent)
- Central line placed recently?
	- ? Iatrogenic pneumothorax
	- ? Cardiac tamponade
- PMHx?
- Review charts
	- Check previous vital signs
	- Review fluid balance → persistent positive fluid balance may be assocaited with fluid overload
	- ? DVT prophylaxis
- Medication chart
## Examination
- Chest sounds
- Heart sounds
- Lower leg swelling (? DVT)

## Investigations
- Bedside: 
	- ECG
		- Review ECG evidence of cardiac disease or indirect evidence of PE
		- Pulmonary embolism![[Pulmonary Embolism#^ecg]]
	- Peak exiratory flow rate to quantify bronchospasm and improvement after bronchodilator therapy
	- VBG or ABG
- Bloods:
	- FBC, UEC, cardiac enzymes and LFTs
		- Cardiac markers only if suspicious of ACS or worsened CCF
- Imaging: 
	- CXR
		- Pneumonia ![[Pneumonia#^pneumonia-cxr]]
		- COPD/Asthma; *CXR not required in exacerbations of asthma that respond promptly to treatment* ![[COPD#^cxr-findings]]
		- APO ![[Acute Pulmonary Oedema#^cxr-findings]] 
		- Pulmonary embolism ![[Pulmonary Embolism#^cxr]]
