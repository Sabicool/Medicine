# Phone Call/Presentation Questions
- Reason for admission
- Is the patient symptomatic:
	- Is the patient cyanosed ⇒ immediate review if so
	- How long has the patient had SOB (i.e. is it sudden ⇒ [Pulmonary Embolism](01%20Disciplines/Respiratory/Conditions/Pulmonary%20Embolism.md) or [Pneumothorax](01%20Disciplines/Respiratory/Conditions/Pneumothorax.md) → immediate review)
	- Associated symptoms: chest pain, cough, fever, stridor, wheeze and facial oedema?
- Other observations
	- Vital signs
- Does the patient have a history of [Heart Failure](01%20Disciplines/Cardiology/Conditions/Heart%20Failure.md) or [Acute Pulmonary Oedema](01%20Disciplines/Respiratory/Conditions/Acute%20Pulmonary%20Oedema.md) or of [Asthma](01%20Disciplines/Respiratory/Conditions/Asthma.md) or [COPD](01%20Disciplines/Respiratory/Conditions/COPD.md)?
- Does the patient have massive haemoptysis ⇒immediate review
## Instructions over the phone
- Ask for measurement of the oxygen saturation by non-invasive pulse oximetry
- Give oxygen by mask to maintain saturation >95%
- Request as high a concentration of $\ce{O2}$ in the short term unless the patient has significant COPD → 28% $\ce{O2}$ by Venturi mask and reassess at the bedside
- Ask the nurse to bring the resuscitation trolley to the bedside, attach an ECG monitor to the patient and gain IV access
- Request ==nebulised salbutamol 5mg (1mL) diluted with 3mL of normal saline if the patient has asthma or wheeze==
- Request ==GTN SL (0.4mg by spray or 0.6mg tablet) if the patient is hypertensive, has chest pain or a history of [Heart Failure](01%20Disciplines/Cardiology/Conditions/Heart%20Failure.md); repeat in 5-10 minutes only if SBP remains >100mmHg==
# Common causes *(Corridor thoughts)*
## Dyspnoea
- Pulmonary causes
	- [Pneumonia](01%20Disciplines/Respiratory/Conditions/Pneumonia.md)
	- Bronchospasm with wheeze ([Asthma](01%20Disciplines/Respiratory/Conditions/Asthma.md), [COPD](01%20Disciplines/Respiratory/Conditions/COPD.md), [Anaphylaxis](01%20Disciplines/Immunology/Emergencies/Anaphylaxis.md))
	- [Pneumothorax](01%20Disciplines/Respiratory/Conditions/Pneumothorax.md)
	- Massive pleural effusion
	- Aspiration of gastric contents or other foreign material
	- Atelactasis (especially post-operative)
	- Interstitial lung disease (sarcoid, occupational, hypersensitivity, drugs)
	- [Pulmonary Hypertension](01%20Disciplines/Cardiology/Conditions/Pulmonary%20Hypertension.md)
- Cardiovascular causes
	- [Acute Pulmonary Oedema](01%20Disciplines/Respiratory/Conditions/Acute%20Pulmonary%20Oedema.md)
	- [Pulmonary Embolism](01%20Disciplines/Respiratory/Conditions/Pulmonary%20Embolism.md)
- Miscellaneous
	- Upper airway obstruction (with stridor; see [Acute Airway Failure](01%20Disciplines/Clinical/Emergencies/Acute%20Airway%20Failure.md))
	- Metabolic acidosis (DKA, [Septicaemia](01%20Disciplines/Infectious%20Disease/Conditions/Septicaemia.md))
	- Neuromuscular weakness (Guillain-Barré syndrome, myaesthenia gravis, muscular dystrophy)
	- Anaemia
	- Hyperthyroidism
	- Poisoning (aspirin, carbon monoxide)
	- Anxiety
## Cough
- Any cardiopulmonary causes as above
- Upper airway stimuli
	- Viral illness or postviral syndromes
	- Sinusitis
	- Gastro-oesophageal reflux
	- Inhalational injury
	- Allergy
	- Malignancy
	- ACE inhibitors (inc. angio-oedema)
## Haemoptysis

# Assessment
## End of Bed
- Does the patient look short of breath?
- Are they able to speak full sentences?
## A → E Assessment
## History
- Reason for patient admission?
- Onset? (was it sudden onset)
- Chest pain?
- Mobilisation (especially if post-op)
- Prior status (e.g. previously independent)
- PMHx
## Examination
- Chest sounds
- Heart sounds
- Lower leg swelling (? DVT)
## Investigations
- Charts
	- Medications
	- DVT prophylaxis
- Bedside: ECG, U/S doppler
- Imaging: CXR, CTPA
## Management
