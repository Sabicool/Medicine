- Reason for admission
- Is the patient symptomatic:
	- Is the patient cyanosed ⇒ immediate review if so
	- How long has the patient had SOB (i.e. is it sudden ⇒ [Pulmonary Embolism](01%20Disciplines/Respiratory/Conditions/Pulmonary%20Embolism.md) or [Pneumothorax](01%20Disciplines/Respiratory/Conditions/Pneumothorax.md) → immediate review)
	- Associated symptoms: chest pain, cough, fever, stridor, wheeze and facial oedema?
- Other observations
	- Vital signs
- Does the patient have a history of [Heart Failure](01%20Disciplines/Cardiology/Conditions/Heart%20Failure.md) or [Acute Pulmonary Oedema](01%20Disciplines/Respiratory/Conditions/Acute%20Pulmonary%20Oedema.md) or of [Asthma](01%20Disciplines/Respiratory/Conditions/Asthma.md) or [COPD](01%20Disciplines/Respiratory/Conditions/COPD.md)?
- Does the patient have massive haemoptysis ⇒immediate review
## Instructions over the phone
- Ask for measurement of the oxygen saturation by non-invasive pulse oximetry
- Give oxygen by mask to maintain saturation >95%
- Request as high a concentration of $\ce{O2}$ in the short term unless the patient has significant COPD → 28% $\ce{O2}$ by Venturi mask and reassess at the bedside
- Ask the nurse to bring the resuscitation trolley to the bedside, attach an ECG monitor to the patient and gain IV access
- Request ==nebulised salbutamol 5mg (1mL) diluted with 3mL of normal saline if the patient has asthma or wheeze==
