# Causes
## Classification
- Hypovolaemic shock
	- Haemorrhagic
		- Traumatic: external or internal (e.g. haemothorax, haemoperitoneum, retroperitoneal haemorrhage)
		- Non-traumatic: external (e.g. haemoptysis, haematemesis, PV bleeding) or internal (e.g. haemothorax, ruptured AAA, bleeding diathesis)
	- Non-haemorrhagic
		- External (e.g. GI losses from diarrhoea and vomiting, burns, hyperthermia, high-output fistulae)
		- Internal (e.g. bowel obstruction, pancreatitis)
- Cardiogenic shock
	- Depressed contractility: ACS, myocarditis, myocardial contusion, cardiomyopathy, drug overdose (e.g. CCB or beta-blocker)
	- Acute valvular dysfunction: Papillary muscle or chordae tendinae rupture, infective endocarditis, severe aortic stenosis or mitral stenosis
	- Arrhythmia: Tachycardia (e.g. VT, AF, SVT), bradycardia (e.g. heart block)
- Distributive shock
	- Anaphylaxis
	- Sepsis
	- Neurogenic: Loss of sympathetic tone from high spinal cord trauma or epidural anaesthesia
	- Drug related: Vasodilator antihypertensive agents, nitrates, strong analgesics
	- Acute adrenal insufficiency: Addison's disease, discontinuing long-term steroids
- Obstructive shock
	- Pulmonary embolism
	- Tension pneumothorax
	- Cardiac tamponade
	- Dynamic hyperinflation: Excessive ventilation with severe bronchospasm ([Asthma](01%20Disciplines/Respiratory/Conditions/Asthma.md), [COPD](01%20Disciplines/Respiratory/Conditions/COPD.md))

# Assessment
- Identify the possible cause as above, assessing volume status and JVP and examining the ECG
	- A low/non-visible JVP suggests hypovolaemic or distributive shock
	- A raised JVP is seen in cardiogenic and obstructive shock

	- ECG changes may be the cause or the effect of the shock state
- Minor insult
	- Check postural HR and BP and repeat the HR and BP after the patient sits or stands for at least 2 minutes
	- An increase in HR >20 beats/min, a fall in SBP >20 mmHg or any fall in DBP indicates postural hypotension
