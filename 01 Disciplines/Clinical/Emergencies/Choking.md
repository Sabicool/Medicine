- Back blows:
	- Stand to the side and sightly behind the patient
	- Support the chest with one hand and lean the patient well forwards
	- Give up to 5 sharp blows between the scapulae with the heel of the other hand
	- Check to see if each back blow has relieved the airway obstruction
- Chest thrusts:
	- Identify the same compression point as for CPR and give up to five chest thrusts
	- Similar to chest compressions but sharper and delivered at a slower rate
- If the obstruction is not relieved, continue alternating 5 back blows with chest thrusts
