- In an unresponsive patient with no signs of life; commence CPR and call the MET
# Airway
- Open and clear the airway and prevent aspiration
- Use airway positioning, suction, airway adjuncts
- See [Acute Airway Failure](01%20Disciplines/Clinical/Emergencies/Acute%20Airway%20Failure.md)
# Breathing
- Assess work and efficacy of breathing including pulse oximetry
- Give oxygen and provide assisted ventilation if ventilatory failure present
- See [Acute Respiratory Failure](01%20Disciplines/Respiratory/Emergencies/Acute%20Respiratory%20Failure.md)
# Circulation
- Recheck vital signs
- Look for shock by assessing tissue perfusion and volume status
- Place ECG and NIBP monitoring
	- Look for unstable arrhythmias or evidence of ACS
- Obtain IV access
	- Commence fluids and haemodynamic support if evidence of circulatory failure
	- Give 20 mL/kg IV fluid rapidly if hypovolaemic shock
- Optimise abnormal cardiac rhythm with cardioversion, pacing or antiarrhythmic agent
- See [Acute Circulatory Failure](01%20Disciplines/Clinical/Emergencies/Shock.md)
# Attach Defibrillator
- Remember safety considerations of attaching a defibrillator using DOOR:
	- D: ensure patient is **d**ry prior to applying pads
	- O: Do not place pads over other **o**bjects (e.g. pacemakers, jewellery, clothes, ECG leads, medication patches)
	- O: **O**xygen to be away from patient prior to pressing the shock button
	- R: Visually **r**e-check and ensure no one is touching the patient prior to pressing the shock button. Ensure that you announce clearly to everyone that you are about to deliver a shock
- Indications
	- VF, pVT and asystole when fine VF cannot be confidently excluded
# Disability
- Assess for depressed [GCS](00%20Reference/Clinical/Glasgow%20Coma%20Scale.md)
	- GCS â‰¤8 indicates inadequate airway protection
- Note pupil size and lateralising signs
- See [Acute neurological failure](01%20Disciplines/Clinical/Emergencies/Unconsciousness.md)
# Environment, exposure and examination
- Measure and normalise body temperature
- Investigations to perform in critically ill patients:
	- Measure and normalise blood glucose
	- VBG/ABG
	- Urinalysis and monitoring of urine output
	- ECG
	- CXR
	- Bloods:
		- FBC, UEC, LFT, blood cultures, blood levels of a measurable drug
	- Other investigations to consider:
		- CT head, LP
- Consider antidotes such as naloxone, electrolyte replacement etc
- Perform full top-to-toe examination (undress the patient)
	- Head and neck including ears, nose, teeth, oral cavity
	- Chest
	- Abdomen
	- Perineum
	- Back (may require a 'log roll')
	- Limbs including peripheral circulation
	- CNS including eyes and cranial nerves, limbs and higher cerebral functions
- Obtain history from any source
- Decide on a working diagnosis and definitive management plan
