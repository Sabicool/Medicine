- Comatose = requires painful stimulus to rouse or if GCS ≤8
# Causes
- Hypoglycaemia
- Opioid/sedative toxicity
- Hypoxia/respiratory failure
- Hypoperfusion
- Stroke such as intracerebral bleed or subarachnoid haemorrhage
- CNS infection (e.g. meningitis)
- CNS trauma (e.g. epidural or subdural haematoma)
- Post-ictal state (⇒ ? underlinyg cause of seizure)
- Hyperthermia (e.g. sepsis)
- Hepatic, renal or endocrine failure
# Assessment
- Initial assessment of ABC and only progress forward once oxygenation and perfusion are stabilised
- Disability (GCS, AVPU, painful stimulus)
- Environment, exposure and extended examination
	- Temperature
	- Fingerprick glucose
	- Focused neurological examination
		- Pupillary constriction ⇒ opioid toxicity or brainstem pathology
		- Neck stiffness ⇒ meningitis or SAH
		- Subtle facial or ocular twitching ⇒ ongoing seizure activity
		- Evidence of head or spine trauma → palpate the skull and neck and look in ears for haemotympanum
		- Lateralising signs including on fundoscopy
# Management
- Call senior
- Stabilise airway, breathing and circulation:
	- Supplemental oxygen and pulse oximetry monitoring
- Spinal immobilisation (if possibility of trauma)
- Non-invasive ECG and BP monitoring
- Reliable IV access
- 50 mL of 50% glucose IV (if fingerprick glucose <2.5 mmol/L)
	- Administer thiamine 250 mg IV prior to this if the patient is alcoholic or appears malnourished (avoids precipitating Wernicke's encephalopathy)
- Titrating 200 microgram boluses of naloxone IV every 5 minutes (if evidence of opioid toxiicty)
- Rapid IV fluid resuscitation if in [Shock](01%20Disciplines/Clinical/Emergencies/Shock.md)
- Antibiotics if fever and/or neck stiffness
- Commence cooling or warming if temperature abnormal
- Urgent CT scan in unresponsive patient with any evidence of head trauma, lateralising neurological signs or undiagnosed coma
