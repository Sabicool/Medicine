1. 5 moments hand hygiene and put on gloves
2. Tourniquet (just below arterial pressure)
	- Toruniquet is too tight if the patient complains or you cannot feel the arterial pulse
3. Apply a towel or bluey below arm
4. Make the vein obvious:
	- Ask the patient for their best vein
	- Blanket/make the patient is warm
	- Put arm below the level of the heart
	- Tap the veins or rub the veins
	- Go for the most distal place that satisfies the purpose
	- Position the arm in line with the motion of your arm (e.g. out to the side)
	- Straighter and larger the vein, the easier
		- Can also go at the point of bifurcation as its less likely to roll away
