# Procedure
1. 5 moments hand hygiene and put on gloves
2. Tourniquet (just below arterial pressure)
	- Toruniquet is too tight if the patient complains or you cannot feel the arterial pulse
	- Can use three tourniquets as well
3. Apply a towel or bluey below arm
4. Make the vein obvious:
	- Veins can take time to stand out, always wait sufficient time for a vein to become apparent
	- Ask the patient for their best vein
	- Blanket/make the patient is warm
	- Warm water in a glove
	- Put arm below the level of the heart
	- Tap the veins or rub the veins
	- Go for the most distal place that satisfies the purpose
	- Position the arm in line with the motion of your arm (e.g. out to the side)
	- Straighter and larger the vein, the easier
		- Can also go at the point of bifurcation as its less likely to roll away

5. Semi-open some of the equipment and have sharps bin nearby
	- Cap the syringe
	- Flush the bung
	- Consider bending the cannula to achieve a shallower angle
6. Ask the patient if they have any allergies
7. Apply chlorhexidine
8. Hold cannula at sides and loosen the cannula and put it back into place
	- Thumb and middle finger
	- Make sure it is the lowest structure of your hand
	![[Pasted image 20250121221617.png]]
	- Make sure your cannula is the parallel to the vein
9. Tense the skin over the side
	- Make sure your thumb when you apply tension is not in the way of the cannula (e.g. over the knuckle edge or to the side slightly)
	- Many ways to apply tension and try to apply counter traction where possible (e.g. flexing the wrist)
		- Can use the C finger approach or can even pull on the skin from both sides

10. Level when you find flushback then advance a few mm
	- Advance the cannula very slowly until you get flushback
	- Rest your hand or any surface you can to reduce tremor
11. Place hand proximally to block vein
12. Loosen tourniquet
13. Dispose cannula
14. Put on bung (jiggle on and then screw)
15. Flush the cannula and can do pulse test
16. Apply tegederm
17. Dispose waste
18. Hand hygiene
