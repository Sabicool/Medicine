# Procedure
Need separate tube for alzheimers
Wrap SAH tap in aluminium foil after collecting

Average patient needs 1/2 to 3/4 of a 9cm long needle
# Results Interpretation
- Request PCR on CSF to diagnose viral [[Meningitis]]
- Typical features of bacterial [[Meningitis]] include:
	- Opening pressure >300mm $\ce{H2O}$
	- Colour may be cloudy, green or purulent
	- WBC count is increased often >1000 per microlitre
	- ↑ CSF protein
	- ↓ CSF glucose to serum glucose ratio
- Gram stain for all patients with suspected CNS infections
- In [[Subarachnoid Haemorrhage]], the CSF appears yellowish
- Demyelinating conditions
	- Typically ↑ CSF protein level but otherwise normal CSF
- Spontaneous intracranial hypotension = opening pressure <60mm $\ce{H2O}$ in an adult
- Idiopathic intracranial hypertension = opening pressure >250mm $\ce{H2O}$ in an adult
	- Can be idiopathic or associated with infectious meningitis or intracranial masses
