# Shockable Rhythms
- The only two shockable rhythms are:
	1. Ventricular fibrillation
	2. Pulseless ventricular tachycardia
- Do not delay defibrillation for *any* other procedure
- Defibrillator attachment and usage
	- Right of the sternum below the clavicle and mid-axillary line at 5th or 6th intercostal space
	- Do not defibrillate over ECG electrodes or leads, GTN patch, internal devices such as a pacemaker or jewellery
	- Shave off excessive hair
	- CPR should continue during charging of the defibrillator: *state loudly: CPR continue, everyone else away, oxygen away*
		- Ensure that no one else is in contact with the bed, IV fluid or the patient and that flowing oxygen is moved from the patient before charging the defibrillator
	- Charge the defibrillator to **200 J biphasic**: *state loudly: Charging defibrillator*
	- Once the defibrillator is charged: *state loudly: Stop CPR and move away*
	- Once confirmed that is safe and still shockable on the monitor: *state loudly: Delivering shock*
- Recommence CPR immediately after shock delivery: *state loudly: Recommence CPR*
	- **Do not check for rhythm or pulse and just recommence CPR immediately**
- Reassess patient and monitor rhythm after one cycle (five sets of 30 compressions:2 breaths over 2 minutes)
- Repeat a single shock if there is persistent VF or pVT
- **Obtain IV access and administer adrenaline 1 mg IV after the second shock**
- Continue the reassess-defibrillate-CPR cycle
- **Give amiodarone 300 mg IV diluted in 5% dextrose up to 20 mL after the third shock**
- Repeat adrenaline 1 mg IV after the fourth shock and every two cycles thereafter (approximately 4 minutes)
- An additional dose of amiodarone 150 mg IV can be considered
- Reassess the patient and rhythm every 2 minutes
## Organised Electrical Activity Present
- If at the 2-minute reassessment organised electrical activity is present, **dump the charge of the defibrillator and feel for a pulse:**
	- If no pulse, continue CPR but switch to the non-shockable algorithm
	- If a pulse is present, commence post-resuscitation care
# Non-Shockable Rhythms
- Non shockable rhythms is basically anything not shockable:
	- Asystole
	- Pulseless electrical activity
- Check that the leads are connected, the monitor gain is turned up and/or try a different lead
