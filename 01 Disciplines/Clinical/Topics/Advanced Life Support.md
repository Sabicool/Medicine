# Shockable Rhythms
- The only two shockable rhythms are:
	1. Ventricular fibrillation
	2. Pulseless ventricular tachycardia
- Do not delay defibrillation for *any* other procedure
- Defibrillator attachment and usage
	- Right of the sternum below the clavicle and mid-axillary line at 5th or 6th intercostal space
	- Do not defibrillate over ECG electrodes or leads, GTN patch, internal devices such as a pacemaker or jewellery
	- Shave off excessive hair
	- CPR should continue during charging of the defibrillator: *state loudly: CPR continue, everyone else away, oxygen away*
		- Ensure that no one else is in contact with the bed, IV fluid or the patient and that flowing oxygen is moved from the patient before charging the defibrillator
	- Charge the defibrillator to **200 J biphasic**: *state loudly: Charging defibrillator*
	- Once the defibrillator is charged: *state loudly: Stop CPR and move away*
	- Once confirmed that is safe and still shockable on the monitor: *state loudly: Delivering shock*
- Recommence CPR immediately after shock delivery: *state loudly: Recommence CPR*
	- **Do not check for rhythm or pulse and just recommence CPR immediately**
- Reassess patient and monitor rhythm after one cycle (five sets of 30 compressions:2 breaths over 2 minutes)
- Repeat a single shock if there is persistent VF or pVT
- **Obtain IV access and administer adrenaline 1 mg IV after the second shock**
- Continue the reassess-defibrillate-CPR cycle
- **Give amiodarone 300 mg IV diluted in 5% dextrose up to 20 mL after the third shock**
- Repeat adrenaline 1 mg IV after the fourth shock and every two cycles thereafter (approximately 4 minutes)
- An additional dose of amiodarone 150 mg IV can be considered
- Reassess the patient and rhythm every 2 minutes
## Organised Electrical Activity Present
- If at the 2-minute reassessment organised electrical activity is present, **dump the charge of the defibrillator and feel for a pulse:**
	- If no pulse, continue CPR but switch to the non-shockable algorithm
	- If a pulse is present, commence post-resuscitation care
# Non-Shockable Rhythms
- Non shockable rhythms is basically anything not shockable:
	- Asystole
	- Pulseless electrical activity
- Check that the leads are connected, the monitor gain is turned up and/or try a different lead
- Continue CPR
- **Obtain IV access and administer adrenaline 1 mg immediately**
- Reassess the patient and rhythm every cycle (five sets of 30 compressions:2 breaths over approximately 2 minutes)
- Give further adrenaline 1 mg IV every two cycles (approximately every 4 minutes)
- Reassess the patient and rhythm every 2 minutes:
	- If VF/pVT then switch to the shockable rhythm algorithm
	- If pulse present, commence post-resuscitation care
# In All Cardiac Arrest
- Insert a LMA or ETT when practical and confirm placement with capnography
	- Ventilate 10 times per minute once a definitive airway is in place without pausing for compressions and monitor using waveform capnography
- *Give at least 20 mL of normal saline to flush any drugs administered and elevate the limb for 10-20 seconds to facilitate drug delivery to the central circulation*
- Establish a second IV line
- Search and correct 4 Hs and 4Ts
	- Consider bedside cardiac ultrasound during resuscitation to find potentially reversible causes
	- Hypoxaemia: Deliver high-flow 100% oxygen and ensure ventilations create a visible rise and fall of both sides of the chest
	- Hypovolaemia: Severe blood loss following surgery or internal haemorrhage and volume loss in anaphylaxis or sepsis may cause cardiac arrest
		- Give fluid/blood replacement rapidly if hypovolaemia is likely and alert the relevant surgeon and theatre
	- Hyper/hypokalaemia, hypocalcaemia, acidaemia and other metabolic disorders
		- Give 10-20 mL of 10% calcium chloride solution IV immediately for hyperkalaemia (e.g. in renal patient who has a cardiac arrest)
		- Consider 50 mL of 8.4% $\ce{NaHCO3-}$ if the patient is severely acidaemic (pH<6.8) and is undergoing prolonged resuscitation or post-resuscitation care; or if there is hyperkalaemia
	- Hypothermia
		- Check core temperature 
	- Tension pneumothorax
		- Usually traumatic, particularly when the patient has positive-pressure ventilation
		- Immediately insert a needle into the chest to decompress if there are asymmetrical chest movements and ventilation requires high pressures
	- Tamponade
		- Usually traumatic but may follow cardiothoracic surgery, MI etc.
		- Perform pericardiocentesis if the patient is in cardiac arrest or peri-arrest
		- Traumatic usually requires an emergency thoracotomy
	- Toxins/poisons/drugs
	- Thrombosis (PE or ACS)
		- Perform vigorous external chest compressions to attempt to break up a massive PE when this is likely, and give a fluid load bolus of 20 mL/kg
		- If high clinical suspicion of a massive PE (or ACS) causing cardiac arrest, a fibrinolytic agent can be given
# Indications for other Drugs
- Calcium: give 10 mL of 10% calcium chloride or 20 mL of 10% calcium gluconate IV for hyperkalaemia, hypocalcaemia or calcium-channel blocker overdose and repeat as necessary
- Lignocaine: initial bolus of 1 mg/kg IV for VF or pVT, when amiodarone is not available, followed by 0.5 mg/kg if necessary. Omit if amiodarone has been given
- Magnesium: give 2.5 g (10 mmol or 5 mL) of 49.3% magnesium sulfate IV in suspected hypomagnesaemia such as in patients with torsades de pointes, on potassium-losing diuretics or with digoxin toxicity
- Sodium bicarbonate: give 50 mmol of 8.4% (50 mL) IV boluses for hyperkalaemia, tricyclic antidepressant or other sodium-channel blocker overdose or severe metabolic acidosis.
# Post Resuscitation Care
- Continue respiratory support
	- Give supplemental oxygen, even if the patient has rapidly returned to consciousness
	- Monitor ABG and titrate inspired oxygen to achieve oxygen saturations of 94-98%
	- Ensure ETT is correctly positioned and secure and organise an immediate CXR
	- Place NG tube to decompress the stomach if the patient is still comatose and/or intubated, confirming again with the CXR
- Maintain cerebral perfusion
	- Maintain SBP >100 mmHg
	- May require intermittent boluses of adrenaline 50-100 mics iV or an adrenaline infusion under close supervision
	- Ensure there is adequate intravascular volume by looking for sources of hypovolaemia, checking JVP or arranging for the insertion of a CVL
	- Treat and prevent cardiac arrhythmias
- Repeat investigations: including a 12-lead ECG, blood glucose, ABG or VBG and electrolytes
- Avoid hypo-/hyperglycaemia or acidosis and control seizures
- Commence targeted temperature management
- Seek and treat underlying cause of the cardiac arrest or any complications of the resuscitations (e.g. pneumothorax from a broken rib or pulmonary aspiration)
- Consider immediate coronary angiography and PCI especially for patients following chest pain or with ST elevation
- Transfer to ICU, cardiac catheter lab or CCU
