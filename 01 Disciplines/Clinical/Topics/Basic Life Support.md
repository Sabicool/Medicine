- In an unresponsive patient with no signs of life; commence CPR and call the MET
# Airway
- Open and clear the airway and prevent aspiration
- Use airway positioning, suction, airway adjuncts
- See [Acute Airway Failure](01%20Disciplines/Clinical/Topics/Acute%20Airway%20Failure.md)
# Breathing
- Assess work and efficacy of breathing including pulse oximetry
- Give oxygen and provide assisted ventilation if ventilatory failure present
# Circulation
- Recheck vital signs
- Look for shock by assessing tissue perfusion and volume status
- Place ECG and NIBP monitoring
	- Look for unstable arrhythmias or evidence of ACS
- Obtain IV access
	- Commence fluids and haemodynamic support if evidence of circulatory failure
	- Give 20 mL/kg IV fluid rapidly if hypovolaemic shock
- Optimise abnormal cardiac rhythm with cardioversion, pacing or antiarrhythmic agent
# Disability
- Assess for depressed [GCS](00%20Reference/Clinical/Glasgow%20Coma%20Scale.md)
	- GCS â‰¤8 indicates inadequate airway protection
- Note pupil size and lateralising signs
# Environment, exposure and examination
- Measure and normalise body temperature
- Measure and normalise blood glucose
- Consider antidotes such as naloxone, electrolyte replacement etc
- Perform full top-to-toe examination
- Obtain history from any source
- Decide on a working diagnosis and defintiive management plan
