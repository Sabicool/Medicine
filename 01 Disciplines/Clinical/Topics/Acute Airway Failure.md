# Causes
- Depressed level of consciousness
- Mechanical obstruction
	- Foreign material (food bolus, vomit, blood, dentures)
	- Laryngospasm (multiple causes, including aspiration)
	- Angio-oedema (alone or as part of anaphylaxis)
	- Infection (para- or retropharyngeal abscess, croup, epiglottitis)
	- Tumour either within or compressing the airway
	- Burns, either inhalation or secondary to caustic ingestion
	- Trauma (fractured mandible, neck haematoma, thyroid cartilage)
# Assessment
- Assess airway function
	- Signs of partial airway obstruction:
		- Hoarse voice, inability to speak or cough 
		- Stridor, snoring or gurgling secretions 
		- Soft-tissue retraction-tracheal tug, rib or abdominal recession 
		- Loss, or an uncoordinated rise and fall, of the chest and / or abdomen 
		- Altered level of consciousness or mental status or agitation 
		- GCS â‰¤8
	- Features of partial airway obstruction
		- Tripod position
		- Reluctance to speak or cough
		- Increased work of breathing with nasal flaring accessory muscle use
	- Inspect
		- Upper airway for foreign material if possible or using laryngoscopy
		- Erythema or urticaria with lip, tongue or palatal swelling
			- Listen for bronchospasm and examine for circulatory features that suggest [Anaphylaxis](01%20Disciplines/Immunology/Conditions/Anaphylaxis.md)
		- Localised trauma, burns infection or tumour
	- Palpate the anterior neck, including the thyroid cartilage for pain, inflammation, crepitus, swelling or masses
	- Investigate for any cause of depressed consicousness (e.g. hypoglycaemia or opioid intoxication)
- Call senior immediately
- [MET call](00%20Reference/Clinical/MET%20Activation%20Criteria.md) should be made for any patient with a threatened airway (including partial airway obstruction)
- Search and treat underlying cause
