# Causes
- Depressed level of consciousness
- Mechanical obstruction
	- Foreign material (food bolus, vomit, blood, dentures)
	- Laryngospasm (multiple causes, including aspiration)
	- Angio-oedema (alone or as part of anaphylaxis)
	- Infection (para- or retropharyngeal abscess, croup, epiglottitis)
	- Tumour either within or compressing the airway
	- Burns, either inhalation or secondary to caustic ingestion
	- Trauma (fractured mandible, neck haematoma, thyroid cartilage)
# Assessment
- Assess airway function
	- Signs of partial airway obstruction:
		- Hoarse voice, inability to speak or cough 
		- Stridor, snoring or gurgling secretions 
		- Soft-tissue retraction-tracheal tug, rib or abdominal recession 
		- Loss, or an uncoordinated rise and fall, of the chest and / or abdomen 
		- Altered level of consciousness or mental status or agitation 
		- GCS â‰¤8
	- Features of partial airway obstruction
		- Tripod position
		- Reluctance to speak or cough
		- Increased work of breathing with nasal flaring accessory muscle use
	- Inspect
		- Upper airway for foreign material if possible or using laryngoscopy
		- Erythema or urticaria with lip, tongue or palatal swelling
			- Listen for bronchospasm and examine for circulatory features that suggest [Anaphylaxis](01%20Disciplines/Immunology/Conditions/Anaphylaxis.md)
		- Localised trauma, burns infection or tumour
	- Palpate the anterior neck, including the thyroid cartilage for pain, inflammation, crepitus, swelling or masses
	- Investigate for any cause of depressed consicousness (e.g. hypoglycaemia or opioid intoxication)
	- Signs and features of complete airway obstruction
		- No stridor, airway sounds or breath sounds on lung auscultation
		- Inability to ventilate the patient with a bag-mask
		- Rapid development of cyanosis and unconsciousness
- Call senior immediately
- [MET call](00%20Reference/Clinical/MET%20Activation%20Criteria.md) should be made for any patient with a threatened airway (including partial airway obstruction)
# Management
- General measures
	- Administer high-flow oxygen and reverse cause of depressed conscioussness
	- Apply non-invasive monitoring, including ECG, pulse oximeter and BP
	- Obtain reliable IV access
	- Call senior for help and summon staff experienced in airway management
	- Reposition the patient if in coma
	- Flex neck at cervicothoracic junction and extend head at the cervico-occipital junction ('sniffing position') provided no neck trauma; place pillow or support behind the head
		![](Attachments/Pasted%20image%2020241214153953.png)
	- Head tilt: tilt the head gently back with pressure on the forehead
	- Jaw thrust: place fingers behind the angle of the mandible and push the jaw forwards to life the soft tissues away from the pharynx to relieve obstruction
		-  Apply with head tilt unless possibility of spine injury
	- Chin lift
		- Single operators at the side of the patient for expired air resuscitation when combining with CPR ([BLS](01%20Disciplines/Clinical/Topics/Basic%20Life%20Support.md))
	- Recovery position: left lateral position to keep airway open and assist in drainage of secretions
		![](Attachments/Pasted%20image%2020241214154402.png)
	- Clear foreign material
		- Manually remove any intra-oral foreign body (e.g. loose-fitting dentures)
		- Suction secretions and smaller foreign material using a large-bore rigid (Yankauer) sucker
		- Laryngoscope and Magil forceps if material is lodged in the upper airway
	- Airway adjuncts
		- Oropharyngeal (Guedel) airway
			- Sized using distance from the angle of the jaw to the centre of the lips
			- Remember to insert upside down and then rotate
			- Not tolerated in a semiconscious patient who will gag or develop laryngospasm
		- Nasopharyngeal airway
			- Sized from the tip of the nose to the tragus of the ear (size 6 or 7 is suitable for adults)
			- Consider spraying the nasal cavity with vasoconstrictor/anaesthetic spray to prevent bleeding and decrease discomfort
			- Lubricate airway thoroughly
			- Better tolerated in semiconscious patient and may be used in patients with clenched jaws or trismus (e.g. during seizure)
		- Laryngeal mask airway
			- 
- Search and treat underlying cause
