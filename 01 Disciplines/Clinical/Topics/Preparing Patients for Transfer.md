# Preparation and Stabilisation Prior to Transfer
- Review patient's airway, breathing and circulation. Have a low threshold for organising procedures such as endotracheal intubation or chest drain insertion if there is any concern that the patient's condition may deteriorate en route.
- Ensure that a minimum of two IV lines are sited in all but the most stable patients; lines should be patent and well secured
- Initiate intermin treatment. Examples include:
	- Oxygen
	- Antiemetics
	- Analgesics
	- Antibiotics
	- Anticonvulsants
	- Spinal immoblisation
	- Splinting of fractures
	- Dressing of wounds
- For intercostal catheter attach a Heimlich flutter valve or transport bag with valve[^1] 
- Ensure relevant documentation is with the patient
