- Adrenal gland hormones:
	- Adrenal cortex
	    - Glucocorticoids (eg cortisol)
	    - Mineralocorticoids (eg aldosterone)
	    - Androgens (eg dehydroepiandrosterone DHEA)
	- Adrenal medulla
	    - Catecholamines (eg adrenaline)
- Adrenal insufficiency = insufficient production of glucocorticoids and mineralocorticoids by the adrenal cortex
	- Androgen production may also be decreased
- Primary adrenal insufficiency = Addison disease; usually caused by autoimmune-related atrophy of the adrenal cortex although other causes include infection and metastatic cancer
- Secondary adrenal insufficiency = Pituitary or hypothalamic disorder causes ↓ adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH)
# Clinical Features
 - Fatigue
 - Anorexia
 - Weight loss
 - Postural hypotension
 - Skin and mucosal hyperpigmentation[^1]
# Diagnosis
- Combination of:
	- Positive short Synacthen test (i.e. an absent or severely blunted plasma cortisol response to tetracosactide 30 to 60 minutes after injection)
	- Elevated ACTH
	- Elevated plasma renin (measured by direct concentration or plasma renin activity)
# Management
- Primary adrenal insufficiency
	- Replacement of glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid
	- Androgen replacement not often required
- Secondary adrenal insufficiency
	- Glucocorticoid replacement only as renal-angiotensin-aldosterone axis intact
- A patient with adrenal insufficiency should:
	- Increase glucocorticoid dose during intercurrent illness
	- Recognise early features of adrenal crisis (eg nausea, vomiting, dehydration, hypotension)
	- Carry injectable hydrocortisone when away from medical care
	- Wear an alert bracelet or necklace
	- Carry a wallet card with details about their condition and treatment
## Glucocorticoid Dosing During Illness and Surgery
- The dose of glucocorticoid must be increased at the onset of a systemic illness or before a surgical procedure
