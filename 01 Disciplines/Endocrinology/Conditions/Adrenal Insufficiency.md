# Definitions
- Adrenal gland hormones:
	- Adrenal cortex
	    - Glucocorticoids (eg cortisol)
	    - Mineralocorticoids (eg aldosterone)
	    - Androgens (eg dehydroepiandrosterone DHEA)
	- Adrenal medulla
	    - Catecholamines (eg adrenaline)
- Adrenal insufficiency = insufficient production of glucocorticoids and mineralocorticoids by the adrenal cortex
	- Androgen production may also be decreased
- Primary adrenal insufficiency = Addison disease; usually caused by autoimmune-related atrophy of the adrenal cortex although other causes include infection and metastatic cancer
- Secondary adrenal insufficiency = Pituitary or hypothalamic disorder causes ↓ adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH)
# Clinical Features
 - Fatigue
 - Anorexia
 - Weight loss
 - Postural hypotension
 - Skin and mucosal hyperpigmentation[^1]
# Diagnosis
- Combination of:
	- Positive short Synacthen test (i.e. an absent or severely blunted plasma cortisol response to tetracosactide 30 to 60 minutes after injection)
	- Elevated ACTH
	- Elevated plasma renin (measured by direct concentration or plasma renin activity)
# Management
- Primary adrenal insufficiency
	- Replacement of glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid
	- Androgen replacement not often required
- Secondary adrenal insufficiency
	- Glucocorticoid replacement only as renal-angiotensin-aldosterone axis intact
- A patient with adrenal insufficiency should:
	- Increase glucocorticoid dose during intercurrent illness
	- Recognise early features of [[Adrenal Crisis|adrenal crisis]] (eg nausea, vomiting, dehydration, hypotension)
	- Carry injectable hydrocortisone when away from medical care
	- Wear an alert bracelet or necklace
	- Carry a wallet card with details about their condition and treatment
- Ongoing monitoring assess for symptoms of:
	- Glucocorticoid excess: weight gain, facial puffiness, peripheral oedema, insomnia, low bone mineral density (measure every 2 years), elevated blood pressure, hyperglycaemia
	- Glucocorticoid deficiency: weight loss, lack of appetite, progressive skin pigmentation, lethargy
	- Mineralocorticoid excess: elevated blood pressure, peripheral oedema, hypokalaemia, low plasma renin concentration
	- Mineralocorticoid deficiency: postural hypotension, tachycardia, hyperkalaemia
	- Patient with autoimmune adrenal insufficiency have increased risk of other autoimmune disorders (e.g. coeliac disease, autoimmune thyroid disease, type 1 diabetes, pernicious anaemia); monitor accordingly
## Glucocorticoid Dosing During Illness
- The dose of glucocorticoid must be increased at the onset of a systemic illness or before a surgical procedure
	- The patient should increase their glucocorticoid dose promptly without regard for time of day or waiting for a doctor
	- Higher dose should be continued for 2-3 days and if the illness has not resolved after 3 days, then the patient should seek medical advice
- Suggested doses for increasing glucocorticoid dose are on eTG and are based on adult/child and choice of glucocorticoid for maintenance therapy
- If the patient has features of impending adrenal crisis (e.g. abdominal pain, dehydration, hypotension) give hydrocortisone 100mg intramuscularly (for adults)
## Glucocorticoid Dosing During Surgery
- Minor procedure that does not require general anaesthetic, sedation or fasting ⇒ double dose of patient’s usual glucocorticoid on the morning of the procedure
	- For root canals double the dose of usual glucocorticoid for a further 24 hours postoperatively
	- For invasive dental procedures not requiring general anaesthetic use a double dose of usual glucocorticoid on the morning of the procedure and for a further 24-48 hours post-operatively
	- For patients with postoperative complications or inability to take oral intake or vomiting, follow as per illness above and administer parenteral hydrocortisone
- For procedures requiring general anaesthetic, sedation or fasting ⇒ start IV hydrocortisone at induction of anaesthesia and continue until oral intake can be tolerated following the procedure
	- Hydrocortisone 100mg IV initially then 50 mg IV 6 hourly until oral therapy is tolerated
## Mineralocorticoid Replacement
- Symptoms of aldosterone deficiency:
	- Postural vertigo/syncope
	- Salt craving
	- Fatigue and weakness
	- Sometimes polyuria/noctuiria
	- Hyperkalaemia
- Replace with fludrocortisone: fludrocortisone 100 micrograms orally, daily. Adjust dose according to postural blood pressure, and serum potassium and plasma renin concentrations. Usual dose 50 to 300 micrograms daily
- Monitor: BP, serum sodium and potassium concentrations, plasma renin concentration
