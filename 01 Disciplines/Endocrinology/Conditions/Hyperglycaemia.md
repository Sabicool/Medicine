# Phone Call/Presentation Questions
- Type 1 or Type 2 diabetic?
	- If type 2, are they normally on insulin
- What medications?
- What have they eaten?
- Reason for admission?
- Otherwise well? Other vitals?
# Common Causes *(Corridor thoughts)*
- Patient adherence to diet
- Steroids
- TPN/PPN
- NG feeds
- Poorly controlled diabetes at home
- Withholding regular antiglycaemics
# Assessment
- Read the patient ntoes as there may be a hyperglycaemia plan documented with a short-acting insulin (usaully Novorapid) sliding scale charted or JMO specific instructions
- The thinksulin app can guide on charting insulin if the patient is hyperglycaemic with no insulin PRN charted
- Check ketones if BSL >20
- Consider if the patient has been recently commenced on steroids (e.g. respiratory conditions)
- Ask the nurses to check BSLs again in 2 hours as Novorapid halfe life of 2-4 hours
# Management
- Short term
	- Start novorapid
- Medium term
	- Sliding scale during period on steroids
	- ? Endo r/v if not well controlled
- Long term
	- Does the patient need more PO medications?
	- Does the patient need to change insulin regime?
	- Who is follow up diabetes management
	- What is his Hba1c
- Other considerations
	- If renal function is low, insulin takes longer to act
	- If type 1 diabetic, always measure ketones
		- If ketones are high, do a VBG to assess if they are acidotic
