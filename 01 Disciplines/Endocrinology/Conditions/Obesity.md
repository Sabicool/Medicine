# Definitions
- Healthy weight: BMI 18.5 to 24.9
- Overweight: BMI 25 to 29.9
- Obesity class 1: BMI 30 to 34.9
- Obesity class 2: BMI 35 to 39.9
- Obesity class 3: BMI 40 or more
- Importantly for patients with BMI<35 measure their waist-to-height ratio to assess central adiposity - NICE guidelines
- Patients from Asian, Middle Eastern, Black African or African-Caribbean family background are more prone to central adiposity so use lower thresholds ⇒ reduce thresholds by 2.5 (i.e. overweight: 22.5 - 27.4) - NICE guidelines
- Can also just measure waist circumference directly (same procedure as waist-to-height ratio)
	- Increased risk in ♂ at 94cm (Asians 90cm) and in ♀ at 80cm
	- Substantially increased risk in ♂ at 102cm and in ♀ at 88cm
Other defintiions:
- Metabolically health obesity = obesity without [[Metabolic Syndrome]]
## Measurement of Weight-Height Ratio
1. Wrap tape measure around waist midway between top of hips and bottom of ribs and breath out naturally before taking the measurement
2. Calculate the ratio by dividing waist by height with both in the same unit (e.g. 96.5cm/170cm = 0.57 or 38 inches/67inches = 0.57)
# Clinical Features
- Dermatologic manigestations:
	- Pseudocanthosis nigricans: diffusely pigmented macules and lentil shaped erosions on the nape of the neck
		![[Pasted image 20250117210402.png]]
	- Acrochordons intertrigo (skin tags): dark-colored pedunculated papules

# Prevention
- Patients with a BMI <35 should be encouraged to measure their own waist-to-height ratio to assess central adiposity
# Management
## Non Pharmacological Measures
- Set /achievable/ goals (e.g. maintenance of 5 to 10% loss of initial body weight, reduction in waist circumference, reduced BP) and *record progress*. Consider referral to other health professionals (eg dietitian, exercise physiologist, psychologist) or a multidisciplinary obesity clinic for expert advice.
- *Shift the energy balance*: reduce energy intake via improved eating habits and increase energy expenditure by reducing sedentary behaviour and increased physical activity
- Can explain to patient as a sea-saw and you have to tip the balance
-  For OSCE purposes can break down into:
	- Set goal: 5-10% of body weight with tracking
	- MDT referral
	- Diets
	- Exercise
	- Behavioural change
## Pharmacological Measures
- Pharmacotherapy for weight management should be seen as an adjunct to lifestyle intervention, just as it is for managing hypertension, diabetes and cardiovascular disease, not as a replacement because of the benefits that lifestyle intervention provides beyond weight reduction.
- Weight loss pharmacotherapy should be considerd for patients with *BMI>30 or those with BMI 27-30 with obesity related complications*.
- Only _orlistat, phentermine and liraglutide_ are approved by TGA for weight reduction (RACGP article from 2017).

### Sympathomimetics
- Work by supressing appetitie
- Examples include phentermine, topiramate
- Should not be used in patients with a history of cardiovascular disease (see image above for other contraindications)
### Lipase Inhibitors
- Works by leading to fat malapsorption (does not work systemically so blocks lipase in the bowel)
- Examples include orlistat
- Particularly useful for patients with diabetes and dyslipiedemia
### GLP-1 Agonists
- Examples include drugs ending in -glutide
- Particularly beneficial for patients with diabetes
## Bariatric Surgery
- Consider for BMI ≥30 with severe comorbidities (e.g. [[Diabetes]], [[Metabolic Syndrome]])
- Indicated for:
	- BMI ≥35 with severe comorbidities
	- BMI ≥40
 - Can broadly be categorised into:
	1. Restrictive procedures which reduce stomach veolume and limit oral intake; examples include sleeve gastrectomy (most common), adjustable gastric banding
	2. Malabsorptive procedures (often performed in conjunction with restrictive) which bypass portions of the small intestine; thereby impairing absorption of macronutrients; examples include Roux-en-Y gastric bypass
![[2024-04-25_20-16-10_screenshot.png]]
- The smaller gastric remnant works to produce a sensatino of satiety
- Gastroplasty and bypass procedures have nutritional complications, in particular producing deficiencies of iron, vitamin B12, folate, vitamin D, calcium, copper and zinc
### Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass
- Weight loss of 25-30% occurs within the first 2 years
- Morbidity up to 15% at 1 year
### Gastric Band
- A plastic band is placed around the stomach 1-2cm below the GOJ
- Weight loss of 20-30% is achieved gradually (2-3 years)
- Morbidity is low (5%)
### Sleeve Gastrectomy
- The greater curve of the stomach is resected leaving a tube of stomach along the lesser curve
- Weight loss of 20-30% is ahevable withinin the first 2 years
- Morbidity is around 11%
### Complications
- General complications: anastomatic leaks, strictures, internal hernias
- Specific
	- Oesophagitis and acid reflux in sleeve gastrectomy
	- Marginal ulceration, gstrogastric fistula, dumping syndrome and choledocholithiasis in Roux-en-Y bypass
	- Oesophageal or gastric perforation and band slippage in gastric banding
- Importantly do not attempt NG tube insertion without consulting the surgical team
# Complications
- Endocrine: [[Diabetes]]
- Cardiovascular
	- Cardiovscular disease
	- Cardiomyopathy and Congestive [[Heart Failure]]
	- DVTs
- Respiratory
	- Obstructive sleep apnoea
	- Obesity hypoventilation syndrome
	- [[Asthma]]
- Other
	- Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis
	- Dementia
	- Osteoarthritis, chronic back pain etc

- Pharmacological management was not on eTG so used this RACGP article: https://www.racgp.org.au/afp/2017/july/pharmacotherapy-for-obesity RACGP - Pharmacotherapy for obesity
- NICE guidelines are fairly comprehensive (see: https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/cg189 Overview | Obesity: identification, assessment and management | Guidance | NICE)
