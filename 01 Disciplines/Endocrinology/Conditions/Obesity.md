* Definitions
	- Healthy weight: BMI 18.5 to 24.9
	- Overweight: BMI 25 to 29.9
	- Obesity class 1: BMI 30 to 34.9
	- Obesity class 2: BMI 35 to 39.9
	- Obesity class 3: BMI 40 or more
- Importantly for patients with BMI<35 measure their waist-to-height ratio to assess central adiposity - NICE guidelines
- Patients from Asian, Middle Eastern, Black African or African-Caribbean family background are more prone to central adiposity so use lower thresholds ⇒ reduce thresholds by 2.5 (i.e. overweight: 22.5 - 27.4) - NICE guidelines
- Can also just measure waist circumference directly (same procedure as waist-to-height ratio)
	- Increased risk in ♂ at 94cm (Asians 90cm) and in ♀ at 80cm
	- Substantially increased risk in ♂ at 102cm and in ♀ at 88cm
Other defintiions:
- Metabolically health obesity = obesity without [[Metabolic Syndrome]]
## Measurement of Weight-Height Ratio
1. Wrap tape measure around waist midway between top of hips and bottom of ribs and breath out naturally before taking the measurement
2. Calculate the ratio by dividing waist by height with both in the same unit (e.g. 96.5cm/170cm = 0.57 or 38 inches/67inches = 0.57)
