# Aetiologies
- Increased binding of calcium to protein
- Magnesium is required for the release of PTH => hypomagnesaemia can precipitate hypocalcaemia

| Factor           | Effect on Ionised Calcium                                     |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Albumin          | increased albumin = decreased ionised calcium                 |
| pH               | increased pH = decreased ionised calcium                      |
| Lactate          | increased lactate = decreased ionised calcium                 |
| Phosphate        | increased phosphate = decreased ionised calcium               |
| Bicarbonate      | increased bicarbonate = decreased ionised calcium             |
| Citrate          | increased citrate = decreased ionised calcium                 |
| Heparin          | Presence of heparin in the sample = decreased ionised calcium |
| Free fatty acids | Increase in free fatty acids = decreased ionised calcium      |

# Investigations
- Correcting $\ce{Ca+}$ for albumin, however evidence demonstrates that formulas actually perform worse than uncorrected calcium levels
$$
\rm{Corrected\;Calcium}=0.8\times(40-\rm{Albumin})+\ce{Ca^{2+}}
$$
