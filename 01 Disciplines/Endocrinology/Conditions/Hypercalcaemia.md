# Aetiology
- Most common causes:
	- Primary hyperparathyroidism
	- Malignancy
		- PTHrP e.g. in squamous cell lung cancer
		- Bone metastases
		- Myeloma
- Other causes
	- Sarcoidosis
	- Vitamin D intoxication
	- Acromegaly
	- Thyrotoxicosis
	- Milk-alkali syndrome
	- Drugs
		- Thiazides
		- Calcium-containing antacids
	- Dehydration
	- [[Addison's Disease]]
	- Paget's disease of the bone with prolonged immobolisation

# Physiology of Calcium Homeostasis
![[Pasted image 20251025122654.png]]
## Parathyroid Hormone
- Secreted by chief cells of the parathyroid glands
- Most regulatory influences on PTH are inhibitory influences (inorganic phosphate is the only proper stimulatory release factor)
- Calcium level and PTH secretion relation is not linear; high calcium can never completely suppress PTH secretion and PTH secretion reaches a peak at calcium concentration of around 0.90 mmol/L
- Effects of PTH
	- Osteoclastic:
	    - Direct effect on decreasing osteoblast activity
	    - Increased osteoclast activity
	    - Thus, increased release of calcium and phosphate from bone, and decreased bone deposition
	- Renal:
	    - Decreased reabsorption of inorganic phosphate at the proximal tubule
	    - Increased reabsorption of calcium at the thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle 
	    - Increased production of production of calcitriol in the kidney, through the stimulation of renal 1α-hydroxylase.
## Calcitonin
- Secreted from parafollicular cells of the thyroid gland
	- Osteoclastic:
	    - Direct effect on decreasing osteoclast activity[^1] 
		- This decreases the resorption of bone, and therefore limits the entry of bone calcium and phosphate into the blood
    - Renal:
        - Calcitonin acts as a weak diuretic, increasing the elimination of sodium, chloride, phosphate and calcium. The effect on calcium is mainly due to inhibited reabsorption.
        - It also increases production of production of calcitriol in the kidney, through the stimulation of renal 1α-hydroxylase.
    - Intestinal:
        - Calcitonin increases gastric acid and pepsin secretion and decreases pancreatic amylase secretion.
        - It has no direct effect on calcium absorption in the intestine, but it can increase it indirectly by stimulating renal calcitriol synthesis
## Action of Biphosphonates
- Inhibition of osteoclast and osteoblast activity
	- Osteoclasts:
		- Inhibition of osteoclast recruitment and adhesion
		- Shortening of the life span of osteoclasts
		- Inhibition of osteoclast activity by inhibiting several essential parts of the cholesterol synthesis pathway
	- Inhibition of calcification by inhibiting the formation of calcium phosphate salts
		- Mainly seen in high doses
		- A totally physicochemical effect: they bind to the calcium of calcium phosphate
		- The result is inhibition of formation and aggregation of calcium phosphate crystals and inhibition of the transformation of amorphous calcium phosphate into hydroxyapatite.
