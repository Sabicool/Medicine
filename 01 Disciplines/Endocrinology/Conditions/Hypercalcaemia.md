# Aetiology
- Most common causes:
	- Primary hyperparathyroidism => rarely causes severe hypercalcaemia
	- Malignancy => more common cause of severe hypercalcaemia
		- PTHrP e.g. in squamous cell lung cancer
		- Bone metastases
		- Myeloma
- Other causes
	- Sarcoidosis
	- Vitamin D intoxication
	- Acromegaly
	- Thyrotoxicosis
	- Milk-alkali syndrome
		- Typically occurs in patients with chronic kidney disease who are on calcium supplementation and vitamin D supplementation for treatment of osteoporosis
	- Drugs
		- Thiazides
		- Calcium-containing antacids
	- Dehydration
	- [[Addison's Disease]]
	- Paget's disease of the bone with prolonged immobolisation

# Physiology of Calcium Homeostasis

## Parathyroid Hormone
- Secreted by chief cells of the parathyroid glands
- Most regulatory influences on PTH are inhibitory influences (inorganic phosphate is the only proper stimulatory release factor)
- Calcium level and PTH secretion relation is not linear; high calcium can never completely suppress PTH secretion and PTH secretion reaches a peak at calcium concentration of around 0.90 mmol/L
- Effects of PTH
	- Osteoclastic:
	    - Direct effect on decreasing osteoblast activity
	    - Increased osteoclast activity
	    - Thus, increased release of calcium and phosphate from bone, and decreased bone deposition
	- Renal:
	    - Decreased reabsorption of inorganic phosphate at the proximal tubule
	    - Increased reabsorption of calcium at the thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle 
	    - Increased production of production of calcitriol in the kidney, through the stimulation of renal 1α-hydroxylase.
## Calcitonin
- Secreted from parafollicular cells of the thyroid gland
	- Osteoclastic:
	    - Direct effect on decreasing osteoclast activity[^1] 
		- This decreases the resorption of bone, and therefore limits the entry of bone calcium and phosphate into the blood
    - Renal:
        - Calcitonin acts as a weak diuretic, increasing the elimination of sodium, chloride, phosphate and calcium. The effect on calcium is mainly due to inhibited reabsorption.
        - It also increases production of production of calcitriol in the kidney, through the stimulation of renal 1α-hydroxylase.
    - Intestinal:
        - Calcitonin increases gastric acid and pepsin secretion and decreases pancreatic amylase secretion.
        - It has no direct effect on calcium absorption in the intestine, but it can increase it indirectly by stimulating renal calcitriol synthesis
## Action of Biphosphonates
- Inhibition of osteoclast and osteoblast activity
	- Osteoclasts:
		- Inhibition of osteoclast recruitment and adhesion
		- Shortening of the life span of osteoclasts
		- Inhibition of osteoclast activity by inhibiting several essential parts of the cholesterol synthesis pathway
	- Inhibition of calcification by inhibiting the formation of calcium phosphate salts
		- Mainly seen in high doses
		- A totally physicochemical effect: they bind to the calcium of calcium phosphate
		- The result is inhibition of formation and aggregation of calcium phosphate crystals and inhibition of the transformation of amorphous calcium phosphate into hydroxyapatite.

# Investigations
- Parathyroid hormone
- Review FBC and film for bone marrow malignancies and metastases
- TSH
- Vitamin D (25-hydroxy) level
- Vitamin A level
- Malignancy related tests
	- Parathyroid hormone related protein
	- Serum protein electrophoresis
	- Prostate specific antigen
	- Skeletal survey
	- Alkaline phosphoatase
- Calcium urine for familial hypocalciuric hypercalcaemia
- Correcting $\ce{Ca+}$ for albumin, however evidence demonstrates that formulas actually perform worse than uncorrected calcium levels
$$
\rm{Corrected\;Calcium}=0.8\times(40-\rm{Albumin})+\ce{Ca^{2+}}
$$

# Management
- Rehydration therapy with sodium chloride 0.9% 4-6 L by IV infusion over 24 hours
	- IV furosemide can be used to treat fluid overload following rehydration but routine use has not been proved as beneficial
	- Avoid hartmann's solution, thiazide diuretics
	- Plasmalyte is often preferred to sodium chloride 0.9% because it causes acidosis and patients with hypercalcaemia often have pre-existing acidosis
	- Aim for urine output of 150-200 mL/hour, but importantly the ongoing infusion of fluid must be balanced to the urine output
- In acute life-threatening hypercalcaemia consider parenteral calcitonin salmon (salcatonin) in addition to biphosphonates to achieve a rapid effect
	- Note that calcitonin causes a temporary reduction in calcium (effect does not work after ~2 days)
- If persisting severe hypercalcaemia after rehydration consider biphosphonate infusion
	- Do not give in milk-alkali syndrome (should resolve without biphosphonate therapy) and pre-menopausal women
	- Zoledronic acid is usually preferred dose-reduced in renal failure
	- Takes time to take effect, hence calcitonin and biphosphonates are oten started simultaneously
- Hypercalcaemia caused by vitamin D toxicity, sarcoidosis or other granulomatous disease consider oral prednisolone
- Galium nitrate can also be considered but requires expert opinion
