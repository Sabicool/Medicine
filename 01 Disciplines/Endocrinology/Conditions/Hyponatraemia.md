# Pathophysiology
- Hyponatraemia generally causes low extracellular osmolality causing fluid shift into the intracellular space
- This can cause cerebral oedema, precipitating the clinical features
# Clinical Features
- Mostly neurological
	- At sodium 125-130 when acute or sodium 120-125 when chronic:
		- Fatigue
		- Headache
		- Nausea and vomiting
	- At sodium 120-125 when acute or sodium 110-120 when chronic:
		- Confusion
		- Seizures
		- Coma
- Presence and severity of symptoms are related to severity of hyponatraemia and speed of derangement (as indicated above)
# Workup
- Determine serum osmolality
- Hypotonic hyponatraemia
	- Determine volume status
		- Hypovolaemic
			- Intra-renal causes: ACE-i, [[Diuretics]], [[Adrenal Insufficiency|Addison disease]], Cerebral sodium wasting syndrome, [[Acute Tubular Necrosis]] → would expect urine sodium to be high >20
			- Extra-renal causes: vomiting, diarrhoea, dehydration, burns, bleeding → would expect urine sodium to be low <10
		- Euvolaemic (usually because of limited free water excretion)
			- SIADH
			- Hypothyroidism
			- Psychogenic polydipsia
			- Iatrogenic SIADH (SSRIs, carbamazepine)
			- Beer potomania
		- Hypervolaemic (fluid overload state)
			- Congestive heart failure
			- Cirrhosis
			- Nephrotic syndrome
			- End stage renal disease
- Isotonic hyponatraemia
	- Hyperlipidaemia, multiple myeloma ⇒ pseudohyponatraemia because of reduction in aqueous plasma
	- TURP syndrome 
		- Dilutional hypontraemia as water is absorbed through water sinuses at surgical site
- Hypertonic hyponatraemia
	- Hyperglycaemia
	- Mannitol
	- Radiocontrast use
	- Highly osmotic agents cause increase in water osmosis into intravascular space causing dilutional hyponatraemia
