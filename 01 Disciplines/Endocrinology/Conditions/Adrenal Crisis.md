# Clinical Features
- Main symptoms are gastrointestinal symptoms and symptoms of [[shock]] (e.g. hypotension and confusion)
- Lab findings:
	- Hypoglycaemia
	- Hyponatraemia
	- Hyperkalaemia
	- Hypercalcaemia
	- Increased urea and creatinine
- Usually occurs in patients with primary adrenal insufficiency and precipitated by stress {e.g. illness or surgery) or abrupt cessation of glucocorticoid therapy
- In patients with hypopituitarism, acute cortisol deficiency can occur but [[shock]] is less likely because of intact RAAS
# Management
- Collect blood samples for plasma glucose and electrolyte concentrations before starting treatment
- If no prior history of primary [[adrenal insufficiency]] also collect plasma cortisol, ACTH and renin concentrations prior to treatment
- For adults start with:
	- Hydrocortisone 100mg IV initially then 50 mg IV every 5 hours until stable and tolerating oral intake
- Correct hypovolaemia as normal with normal saline
- Correct hypoglycaemica 
- Hyperkalaemia usually responds to IV fluids and hydrocortisone; insulin dextrose infusion not commonly used
