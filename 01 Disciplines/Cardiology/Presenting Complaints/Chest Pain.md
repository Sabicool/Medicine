# Phone Call/Presentation Questions
- Pain (SOCRATES):
	- Characteristic?
	- Does it change with breathing?
	- Where is the pain maximal? Radiation?
	- How severe is the pain?
- Vital signs?
- Reason for admission?
- Does the patient have a history of ischaemic heart disease?
	- If yes, is it similar to their usual angina or previous MI?
## Instructions over the phone
- If you suspect AMI or angina (heavy, crushing, tight pain radiating to jaw or left or right arm):
	- Ask the nurse to stay by the patient's bedside and call for additional nursing staff if necessary
	- Give oxygen if hypoxic or shocked maintaining a saturation of >94% after attaching monitoring (pulse oximetry and cardiac monitoring)
	- Urgent 12-lead ECG
	- ==Aspirin 150-300 mg PO== unless contraindicated by hypersensitivity
	- Administer ==GTN SL (0.6 mg tablets or 0.4mg spray)== and repeat every 5-10 minutes if pain persists and SBP remains >90mmHg
		![[Pasted image 20241225125737.png]]
	- Request and IV trolley for the patient's bedside with a range of cannulae ready for insertion
- Attend any patient with chest pain immediately
# Common Causes *(Corridor Thoughts)*
- Cardiac
	- [[Acute Coronary Syndromes|ACS]]
	- Acute aortic dissection
	- [[Pericarditis]]
- Respiratory
	- [[Pulmonary Embolism|PE]]
	- [[Pneumonia]]
	- [[Pneumothorax]]
- Gastrointestinal
	- Oesophagitis, Oesophagel spasm
	- Ruptured oesophagus (inc. Boerhaave's syndrome)
	- Hiatus hernia
	- Peptic ulcer disease
	- Biliary colic/cholecystitis
- Musculoskeletal
	- Costochondritis
	- Fractured rib
	- Referred pain from spinal disease
	- Herpes zoster or postherpetic neuralgia
- Psychiatric
	- Anxiety and panic disorders

The main ones to rule out are ACS (and its complications), acute aortic dissection, PE
# Assessment
## Initial Assessment (if not done on the phone)
- Aspirin 300 mg soluble
- IV access, bloods (including troponin), cardiac monitoring, CXR and analgesia
- ECG at 0 and 2 hours, when repeating troponin and every 30 minutes if ongoing symptoms
	- If meets STEMI criteria (will need senior input) see [[Acute Coronary Syndromes#STEMI#Management|STEMI Management]] ![[Acute Coronary Syndromes#^stemi-criteria]]
- GTN: caution if SBP<100mmHg and in right sided and inferior infarcts
- $\ce{O2}$ if $S\rm{p}\ce{O2}$<93% otherwise not required in stable patients
## End of Bed
- Patients with chest pain from ACS may look anxious and pale, or are shocked, breathless and clearly unwell
- Patients with aortic dissection have severe pain and are restless and agitated
- Patients with PE, pericarditis or pneumothorax are dyspnoeic and breathe with shallow, painful respirations (pleuritic pain)
- However, even if patients look well and appear comfortable at rest, they may still have a life-threatening underlying cause such as ACS, aortic dissection or PE
## A → E Assessment
Prioritise assessing C in stable patients; see immediate management below
- C
	- Blood pressure?
		- Most patients have normal BP
		- Take BP in both arms if the pain is suspicious of aortic dissection (sudden onset, sharp, tearing or migratory) 
			- Acute aortic dissection (AAD) suggested by a difference of >15mmHg
		- Hypotension occurs in ACS, massive PE and AAD with cardiac tamponade
		- Hypertension with ACS or aortic dissection should be treated urgently in resuscitation area (see: [[Hypertensive crisis]])
	- Heart rate?
		- If HR >150 or <40 obtain 12 lead ECG and/or rhythym strip to diagnose the arrhythymia
			- Consider AF or VT in HR>140 and therefore consider urgent cardioversion especially if associated with chest pain or hypotension
		- Immediate treatment of bradycardia is not required unless the patient is hypotensive or syncopal and/or the rate is extremely slow (<40)
	- ECG?
		- Compare with old tracing if possible
		- ST elevation or depression, T wave changes and presence of new Q waves suggest myocardial ischaemia from ACS
		- Only 50% of patients with ACS will have a diagnostic ECG, with non-specific or no initial ECG changes in the remainder
			- Make the diagnosis based of troponins in this case
		- The ECG in a patient with pericarditis shows diffuse, concave ST-segment elevation with PR depression
		- If the first ECG is non-diagnostic repeat after 15 minutes if the chest pain is continuing
			- Repeat the ECG whenever the chest pain recurs, stops or changes in severity or character, as well as after 6–8 hours with repeat cardiac biomarkers (troponin) to rule out ACS
## Immediate Management
- Call senior for:
	- Persistent hypoxia, hypotension or altered mental status despite the above measures
	- HR >150 beats/min or <40 beats/min associated with hypotension as cardioversion or pacing may be required
	- Persistent pain and ST segment changes on ECG; need senior input to determine if STEMI is due to atherosclerosis or alternative cause
- Position the patient in the position of comfort
- A
	- Address any airway compromise (see [[Acute Airway Failure]])
- Attach continuous non-invasive ECG, BP and pulse oximeter monitoring to the patient
- B
	- Commence oxygen if hypoxic or shocked to maintain oxygen saturation >94%
		- High-dose 40-60% oxygen unless obstructive airway disease ⇒ 28% Venturi mask
- C
	- For possible STEMI or high risk ACS with haemodynamic compromise move patient to the resuscitation area and/or attach patient to a defibrillator
	- Commence or continue initial therapy for acute chest pain of possible cardiac origin:
		- ==Aspirin 300 mg orally, chewed or dissolved before swallowing==
			![[Pasted image 20241225120929.png]]
		- GTN Spray (400-800 micrograms) or tablet (300-600 micrograms SL) x1
			![[Pasted image 20241225125737.png]]
		- If SBP >90mmHg (and ongoing chest pain)
			- Second dose of ==GTN 300-600 microgram SL== and a third after 5 more minutes if pain still present; caution in right-sided and inferior infarcts → try look at ECG first (II, III, avF)
			- Give ==morphine 2.5-5mg IV== with ==metoclopramide 10-20mg IV== for nausea, if pain persists despite two to three doses of GTN
				- Can also use fentanyl ==25-50 microgram IV== as an initial dose repeated every 5 to 10 minutes if required
				- Older patients start at lower end of dose range
			![[Pasted image 20241223210632.png]]
		- If SBP <90mmHg
			- Check that the lung bases are clear to auscultation and give a bolus of 125-250mL IV normal saline
			- If bases has signs of pulmonary oedema with an S3 gallop tachypnoea and basal crackles, treat as cardiogenic [[shock]]
	- Establish IV access with two cannulae in peripheral veins if not done so already
		- Draw and send bloods for: FBC, UEC, cardiac biomarkers (troponin I and T) and caogulation profile
	- Examine for signs of shock: (tachcardia and CRT ≥3 seconds) and/or abnormal skin perfusion and/or hypotension
		- If shock (as above) and/or SBP <90mmHg give 250mL of 0.9% saline bolus
		- Monitor patients with CCF for signs of fluid overload
- D
	- Measure GCS
	- Manage pain (see [[Pain Management]]) if not done so already
		- Mild: paracetamol 1000mg oral
		- Moderate: (+paracetamol 1000mg oral)
			- Oxycodone
				- 16-65 years: 5mg oral, repeat if required after 30 minutes, max dose 10mg
				- ≥65 years: 2.5mg oral, repeat after 30 minutes, max dose 5mg
		- Severe: (do not give morphine or fentanyl if SBP <100mmHg)
			- Morphine IV
				- 16-65 years: 5mg IV, repeat if required after 5 minutes, max dose 10mg
				- ≥65 years: 2.5mg IV, repeat if required after 5 minutes, max dose 5mg
			- OR Fentanyl IV
				- 16-65 years: 50mcg IV, repeat after 5 minutes, max dose 100 mcg
				- ≥65 years: 25mcg IV, repeat after 5 minutes, max dose 50mcg
- Exposure
	- Measure temperature
- Fluids
	- Commence fluid balance chart as required
	- Manage nausea and vomiting if not done so already
		- metoclopramide 10 mg orally **or** IV/IM once only (over 20 years only)
		- **or** ondansetron 4 mg orally **or** IV/IM. If symptoms persist after 60 minutes, repeat once, maximum dose 8 mg
		- **or** prochlorperazine 5 mg orally once only **or** 12.5 mg IV/IM once only
- Glucose
	- Measure BGL
	- If BGL<4mmol/L and NO ↓LOC → give sugary drink
	- If BGL<4mmol/L and ↓LOC → glucose 10% 200mL by infusion over 15 minutes once only or glucagon 1mg IM
- Portable CXR

## Selective History and Chart Review
- Onset of the chest pain?
	- Crescendo, build-up of pain ⇒ [[Acute Coronary Syndromes|ACS]]
	- Sudden onset ⇒ [[Pulmonary Embolism|PE]], aortic dissection, oesophageal rupture
	- With physical exertion or emotional stress ⇒ [[Acute Coronary Syndromes|ACS]]
	- With coughing ⇒ [[Pneumothorax]], also see [[Shortness of Breath, Cough and Haemopytsis|Cough]]
	- Sudden onset + vomiting ⇒ oesophageal rupture
- Character of pain?
	- Get a score and get the patient to rescore to get an ongoing evaluation
	- Is the pain like the patient's previous usual angina pain?
	- Crushing, vice-like or squeezing pain is characteristic of ACS, but note that ‘atypical’ pain still due to ACS occurs in women, elderly people and those with diabetes and renal impairment
	- Tearing or ripping pain is characteristic of an AAD. Likewise, severe pain that is poorly relieved by large doses of morphine suggests an aortic dissection or an oesophageal rupture
	- Sharp, well-localised pain suggests a pleuritic or musculoskeletal origin
- Related symptoms?
	- Nausea, sweating and light headedness
	- Collapse or syncopal episode should be taken seriously
	- Dyspnoea
- Alleviating or aggravating factors?
	- Worse on coughing or deep breathing → pleuritic chest pain ⇒ [[Pneumothorax]], [[Pericarditis]], [[Pulmonary Embolism|PE]], [[Pneumonia]], rib fracture or costochondritis
	- Worse on deep inspiration, lying flat or when raising both legs ⇒ [[Pericarditis]]
	- Worse on swallowing ⇒ oesophageal source or [[Pericarditis]]
	- Specific movements ⇒ MSK
- PMHx
	- ACS is more likely when:
		- Ischaemic heart disease 
		- Increasing age >65 years 
		- Comorbid conditions: Diabetes, hypertension, smoking, hyperlipidaemia or end-stage renal disease
		- Family history of premature ischaemic heart disease in first-degree relative under age 50 years 
	- Aortic dissection is more likely when:
		- Aged 60-80
		- Male with chronic hypertension
		- Younger patients with connective tissue disorder (e.g. Marfan's or Ehler-Danlos syndrome)
		- Family history
	- PE is more likely when:
		- Recent surgery, immbolisation, malignancy, prior VTE
		- Family history of 1° relative with thromboembolism
- Charts:
	- Confirm prescribed antianginal medications are given
	- Check for DVT prophylaxis
	- Check for corticosteroids or NSAIDs as a possible cause of gastritis or oesophagitis
