# Phone Call/Presentation Questions
- Pain (SOCRATES):
	- Characteristic?
	- Does it change with breathing?
	- Where is the pain maximal? Radiation?
	- How severe is the pain?
- Vital signs?
- Reason for admission?
- Does the patient have a history of ischaemic heart disease?
	- If yes, is it similar to their usual angina or previous MI?
## Instructions over the phone
- If you suspect AMI or angina (heavy, crushing, tight pain radiating to jaw or left or right arm):
	- Ask the nurse to stay by the patient's bedside and call for additional nursing staff if necessary
	- Give oxygen if hypoxic or shocked maintaining a saturation of >94% after attaching monitoring (pulse oximetry and cardiac monitoring)
	- Urgent 12-lead ECG
	- ==Aspirin 150-300 mg PO== unless contraindicated by hypersensitivity
	- Administer ==GTN SL (0.6 mg tablets or 0.4mg spray)== and repeat every 5-10 minutes if pain persists and SBP remains >90mmHg
	- Request and IV trolley for the patient's bedside with a range of cannulae ready for insertion
- Attend any patient with chest pain immediately
# Common Causes *(Corridor Thoughts)*
- Cardiac
	- [[Acute Coronary Syndromes|ACS]]
	- Acute aortic dissection
	- [[Pericarditis]]
- Respiratory
	- [[Pulmonary Embolism|PE]]
	- [[Pneumonia]]
	- [[Pneumothorax]]
- Gastrointestinal
	- Oesophagitis, Oesophagel spasm
	- Ruptured oesophagus (inc. Boerhaave's syndrome)
	- Hiatus hernia
	- Peptic ulcer disease
	- Biliary colic/cholecystitis
- Musculoskeletal
	- Costochondritis
	- Fractured rib
	- Referred pain from spinal disease
	- Herpes zoster or postherpetic neuralgia
- Psychiatric
	- Anxiety and panic disorders

The main ones to rule out are ACS (and its complications), acute aortic dissection, PE
# Assessment
## End of Bed
- Patients with chest pain from ACS may look anxious and pale, or are shocked, breathless and clearly unwell
- Patients with aortic dissection have severe pain and are restless and agitated
- Patients with PE, pericarditis or pneumothorax are dyspnoeic and breathe with shallow, painful respirations (pleuritic pain)
- However, even if patients look well and appear comfortable at rest, they may still have a life-threatening underlying cause such as ACS, aortic dissection or PE
## A â†’ E Assessment
Prioritise assessing C in stable patients:
- C
	- Blood pressure?
		- Most patients have normal BP
		- Take BP in both arms if the pain is suspicious of aortic dissection (sudden onset, sharp, tearing or migratory) 
			- Acute aortic dissection (AAD) suggested by a difference of >15mmHg
		- Hypotension occurs in ACS, massive PE and AAD with cardiac tamponade
		- Hypertension with ACS or aortic dissection should be treated urgently in resuscitation area (see: [[Hypertensive crisis]])
	- Heart rate?
		- If HR >150 or <40 obtain 12 lead ECG and/or rhythym strip to diagnose the arrhythymia
			- Consider AF or VT in HR>140 and therefore consider urgent cardioversion especially if associated with chest pain or hypotension
