# Tachyarrhythmias
## Phone Call/Presentation Questions
- Heart rate>
- Regular or irregular?
- Blood pressure?
- Chest pain, dyspnoea or altered mental status?
- History of illicit durg use?
- Temperature?
- Reason for admission?
### Instructions over the phone
- When the patient has chest pain, SOB, SBP <90mmHg or altered mental status:
	- Ask the nurse to stay by the patient's bedside and get help from additional nursing staff
	- Give oxygen by mask to maintain saturation >94% and attach monitoring (pulse oximeter and cardiac monitor, request an ECG)
	- Request IV trolley for patient's bedside with two cannulae ready for insertion
	- Request the cardiac arrest trolley with defibrillator and resuscitation equipment be brought to the patient's bedside
- See any patient with tachycardia and signs of circulatory compromise such as chest pain, SOB, hypotension or an altered mental status immediately; or if the HR >140 beats/min, as this will trigger a MET call
## Common Causes
- Rapid regular heart rate
	- Sinus tachycardia
	- Atrial flutter (with constant AV conduction 2:1 or 3:1)
	- Supraventricular tachycardia
	- Paroxysmal atrial tachycardia
	- Junctional tachycardia
	- Ventricular tachycardia
- Rapid irregular heart rate
	- Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response
	- Atrial flutter with variable AV conduction/block
	- Multifocal atrial tachycardia
	- Sinus tachycardia with PACs or PVCs

## Assessment
### End of Bed
Patients who are normotensive with a tachycardia or arrhythmia may look deceptively well
### A → E Assessment
- Heart rate
	- Take the patient's pulse, listen to the apex beat or read the ECG rhythm strip
	- Feel for the volume of the pulse and its regularity
- ECG
	- Does the ECG also demonstrate ischaemic changes?
	- Steps in assessing a tachycardia in an ECG:
		1. Wide vs narrow complex (narrow = SVT, wide = VT)
		2. Regular vs irregular
		3. P waves and origin
	- Broad-complex tachycardia in an older patient, or in any patient with known prior myocardial ischaemia, is probably VT and should be treated as such
- Blood pressure
	- If hypotensive can be due to:
		- Hypotension with a compensatory tachycardia (usually sinus, but may be AF)
		- Tachycardia causing hypotension (most commonly VT, AF with RVR and SVT)
- Respiratory rate
	- Consider if the patient has APO
## Management
### Immediate Management
- Tachycardia in a haemodynamically unstable patient with hypotension, chest pain, SOB and/or altered mental status:
	- Call for senior help.
	- Apply high-flow oxygen by mask, and gain IV access.
	- Attach an ECG monitor/defibrillator to the patient.
	- Confirm the cardiac rhythm with a 12-lead ECG (do not try to diagnose the rhythm without a formal 12-lead ECG, except in a dire emergency).
	- Prepare procedural sedation, such as propofol 200 mg in 20 mL IV, and keep readily available. Call an anaesthetist, as cardioversion will be required.
	- A patient who is haemodynamically unstable and has VT, AF with rapid ventricular response or SVT requires emergency synchronised DC cardioversion
		- Unless the patient is in cardiac arrest (in which case an immediate non-synchronised shock is given), always wait for senior staff to attend. Never administer procedural sedation and proceed to electrical DC cardioversion alone
		- One doctor must attend to the airway, while the other operates the defibrillator and coordinates the cardiac care.
		- Start with 120–150 J biphasic and repeat up to three times, with stepwise increases in joules.
	- Note: if the patient is hypotensive and the rhythm is sinus tachycardia, the most likely cause is underlying hypotension.
		- Look for and urgently treat any cause(s) for this, such as hypovolaemia, hypoxia, fever etc, and consider other precipitants of the tachycardia, such as anaemia or pain
## Selective History and Chart Review
- Only if the patient is stable or immediate management has been commenced and help is on its way
- Onset of palpitations?
	- Sudden onset ⇒ new acute arrhythmia
	- Gradual onset ⇒ worsening of chronic arrhythmia such as AF
	- Recurrent intermittent episodes ⇒ paroxysmal arrhythmia or ectopic beats
	- Following chest pain ⇒ ischaemia as the cause; palpitations followed by pain ⇒ ischaemia 2° to arrhythmia
- Related symptoms?
	- Sweating, light-headedness, chest pain, dyspnoea or syncope ⇒ circulatory compromise
- PMHx
	- Patient's cardiac history?
		- Previous episodes, investigations, treatment given and success (e.g. patients with SVT may have had vagal manoeuvre or adenosine)
		- Precipitating factors:
			- Chest pain, dizzy spell or collapse
		- Ischaemic heart disease, atherosclerosis risk factors (SNAPW, hypertension, hypercholesterolaemia, diabetes, renal disease, positive family history)
		- Pericarditis
		- Structural heart disease (e.g. valvular disease, cardiomyopathy, congenital heart disease or recent cardiac surgery)
		- Thyroid disease
		- Illicit drug use such as cocaine or amphetamines
	- Family history of palpitations, syncope or sudden cardiac death?
		- Premature sudden death consider [[Wolf-Parkinson-White syndrome|WPW]], [[Brugada syndrome]], [[long QT syndrome]] or [[Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy|HCM]]
- Charts
	- Previous ECGs
	- Medications causing tachycardias (e.g. salbutamol, terbutaline, pseudoephedrine or anticholinergics)
	- Previous echocardiography reports
