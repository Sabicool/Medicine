# Tachyarrhythmias
## Phone Call/Presentation Questions
- Heart rate>
- Regular or irregular?
- Blood pressure?
- Chest pain, dyspnoea or altered mental status?
- History of illicit durg use?
- Temperature?
- Reason for admission?
### Instructions over the phone
- When the patient has chest pain, SOB, SBP <90mmHg or altered mental status:
	- Ask the nurse to stay by the patient's bedside and get help from additional nursing staff
	- Give oxygen by mask to maintain saturation >94% and attach monitoring (pulse oximeter and cardiac monitor, request an ECG)
	- Request IV trolley for patient's bedside with two cannulae ready for insertion
	- Request the cardiac arrest trolley with defibrillator and resuscitation equipment be brought to the patient's bedside
- See any patient with tachycardia and signs of circulatory compromise such as chest pain, SOB, hypotension or an altered mental status immediately; or if the HR >140 beats/min, as this will trigger a MET call
## Common Causes
- Rapid regular heart rate
	- Sinus tachycardia
	- Atrial flutter (with constant AV conduction 2:1 or 3:1)
	- Supraventricular tachycardia
	- Paroxysmal atrial tachycardia
	- Junctional tachycardia
	- Ventricular tachycardia
- Rapid irregular heart rate
	- Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response
	- Atrial flutter with variable AV conduction/block
	- Multifocal atrial tachycardia
	- Sinus tachycardia with PACs or PVCs
## Assessment
### End of Bed
Patients who are normotensive with a tachycardia or arrhythmia may look deceptively well
