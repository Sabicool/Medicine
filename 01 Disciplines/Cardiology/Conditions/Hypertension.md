- Note that it is not the absolute BP level that dictates the need for intervention, but rather the threat to organ dysfunction
# Phone Call/Presentation Questions
- How high is the BP and what has it been previously?
- What was the reason for admission?
- Is the patient pregnant? ⇒ pre-eclampsia
- Does the patient have symptoms suggestive of a hypertensive emergency?
	- Sudden onset chest or back pain ⇒ aortic dissection
	- Chest pain, arrhythmia or dyspnoea ⇒ [[Acute Coronary Syndromes]] and or [[Acute Pulmonary Oedema]]
	- Sudden headache, vomiting, confusion, seizure ⇒ SAH or hypertensive encephalopathy
- What antihypertensive medication has the patient been taking?
- Is the patient taking a MAOI antidepressant
## Instructions Over the Phone
- If features of hypertensive emergency or pregnant:
	- Ask the nurse to stay by the patient's bedside and get help from additional nursing staff
	- Administer oxygen to maintain saturation >94%
	- Attach ECG and pulse oximetry monitoring to the patient
	- Request an IV trolley at the patient's bedside with a selection of cannulae ready for insertion if not already in place
	- If asymptomatic and no abnormal clinical signs, ask the nurse to check the BP again in 10 minutes and call you back with the result
	- Ensure that the patient's regular antihypertensive medication has not been missed recently
- Hypertension associated with acute end-organ damage needs to be seen immediately (hypertensive emergency)
- Hypertension in an asymptomatic patient does not need to be assessed immediately irrespective of how high the BP is; the BP can be safely brought under control over the following hours or days[^1]
