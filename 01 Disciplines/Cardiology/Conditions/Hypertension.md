- Note that it is not the absolute BP level that dictates the need for intervention, but rather the threat to organ dysfunction
# Phone Call/Presentation Questions
- How high is the BP and what has it been previously?
- What was the reason for admission?
- Is the patient pregnant? ⇒ pre-eclampsia
- Does the patient have symptoms suggestive of a hypertensive emergency?
	- Sudden onset chest or back pain ⇒ aortic dissection
	- Chest pain, arrhythmia or dyspnoea ⇒ [[Acute Coronary Syndromes]] and or [[Acute Pulmonary Oedema]]
	- Sudden headache, vomiting, confusion, seizure ⇒ SAH or hypertensive encephalopathy
- What antihypertensive medication has the patient been taking?
- Is the patient taking a MAOI antidepressant
## Instructions Over the Phone
- If features of hypertensive emergency or pregnant:
	- Ask the nurse to stay by the patient's bedside and get help from additional nursing staff
	- Administer oxygen to maintain saturation >94%
	- Attach ECG and pulse oximetry monitoring to the patient
	- Request an IV trolley at the patient's bedside with a selection of cannulae ready for insertion if not already in place
	- If asymptomatic and no abnormal clinical signs, ask the nurse to check the BP again in 10 minutes and call you back with the result
	- Ensure that the patient's regular antihypertensive medication has not been missed recently
- Hypertension associated with acute end-organ damage needs to be seen immediately (hypertensive emergency)
- Hypertension in an asymptomatic patient does not need to be assessed immediately irrespective of how high the BP is; the BP can be safely brought under control over the following hours or days[^1]
# Common Causes *(Corridor Thoughts)*
- Essential hypertension
- Secondary hypertension
	- Obstructive uropathy, renal artery stenosis, chronic pyelonephritis
	- Glomerulonephritis, diabetic renal disease, polycystic kidney disease
	- Endocrine disease such as Cushing's syndrome, Conn's syndrome, acromegaly, thyrotoxicosis, myxoedema
	- Autoimmune disease such as SLE or scleroderma
- Medications
	- Corticosteroids, oral contraceptive pill, NSAIDs
- Catecholamine related
	- Phaeochromacytoma
	- Drug overdose (especially cocaine, amphetamines, ecstasy)
- Medication withdrawal
	- Abrupt withdrawal from a beta-blocker, clonidine or ACE inhibitor resulting in a rebound hypertensive crisis
- Drug interaction
	- MAOI antidepressant in combination with a sympathomimetic or other psychoatcive drug or a food containing tyramine (e.g. cheese or wine)
- Neurogenic
	- Anxiety (e.g. white coat hypertension, unexpected/distressing hospital admission)
	- Raised intracranial pressure (e.g. Cushing's reflex of hypertension and bradycardia)
	- Cerebral ischaemia (e.g stroke)
- Other
	- Preeclampsia
	- Coarctation of the aorta
	- Polycytheaemia
	- Hypercalcaemia
	- Hyperparathyroidism
	- Sleep apnoea
- Other miscellaneous that cause transient ↑ BP: pain, bladder distension, alcohol or nicotine withdrawal, agitation and anxiety
# Assessment
## End of Bed
- The initial appearance often undermines the situation; even a patient with hypertensive encephalopathy may look deceptively well
## A → E Assessment
- Blood pressure? 
	- Retake the blood pressure in both arms (lower pressure in one arm can indicate aortic coarctation)
- Heart rate?
	- Bradycardia and hypertension in a patient not on beta-blockers ⇒ ? ↑ICP
	- Tachycardia and hypertension ⇒ catecholamine related cause
- Respiratory rate?
	- Dyspnoea may indicate pulmonary oedema with acute LVF → listen at lung bases for confirmatory basal crackles
# Immediate Management
- If acutely symptomatic or suggestive of a serious cause:
	- Call for senior help
	- Oxygen to maintain the saturation >94%
	- Attach cardiac monitoring and pulse oximeter to the patient
	- Establish IV access
	- Acute lowering of the BP may be required but only when critical hypertensive emergency is diagnosed
		- The choice of antihypertensive agent otherwise depends on cause of the hypertension, age and medical history
# Selective History and Chart Review
- Signs of end-organ damage indicating a hypertensive emergency?
	- Sudden onset tearing chest or back pain ⇒ [[Aortic Dissection]]
	- Focal weakness or sensory symptoms ⇒ [[Aortic Dissection]]
	- Shortness of breath, orthopnoea ⇒ [[Acute Pulmonary Oedema]]
	- Chest pain ⇒ myocardial ischaemia
	- Sudden headache, confusion ⇒ Subarachnoid haemorrhage
	- Headache, nausea and vomiting, confusion, blurred vision ⇒ Hypertensive encephalopathy
- Does the patient have a history of hypertension or any risk factors for hypertension?
	- Ask specifically about previously diagnosed renal, autoimmune or endocrine disease, amphetamine or cocaine use, steroid therapy or progressive uraemia (renal hypertension)
- Was the patient taking antihypertensive medications prior to coming to hospital?
	- Prescribed antihypertensive agents
		- Also consider over-the-counter remedies containing ephedrine, liquorice, St John's wort
	- Check medication chart to ensure the patient's normal antihypertensive medications have been charted
	- Discontinuation of an antihypertensive medication often happens at admission → look back in the chart or for a GP's letter
- Charts
	- Observation chart
		- Check previous BP measurements and confirm that is abnormally high for the patient (check modifications)
		- Decide whether there has been a sudden or slow change
		- Check the HR (is the hypertension associated with tachycardia or bradycardia)
	- Medication chart
		- Check for prescribed agents that cause hypertension:
			- Corticosteroid
			- Amphetamine derivative (usually prescribed for appetite suppression or narcolepsy)
			- NSAIDs
			- Nasal decongestants (e.g. pseudoephidrine within 14 days of a MAOI)
			- Oral contraceptive pill
			- MAOI

# Investigations
- Bedside
	- ECG
	- Urinalysis
			- Urinary beta-hCG in women of childbearing age (pre-eclampsia)
			- Proteinuria (pre-eclampsia, nephrotic syndrome, glomerulonephritis)
			- Haematuria (renal hypertension, glomerulonephritis, nephritic syndrome)
- Bloods
	- FBC (polycythaemia, anaemia with chronic renal disease)
	- U&E to determine renal function (cause or effect of hypertension)
	- LFTs including urate (pre-eclampsia)
- Imaging
	- CXR may show
		- Cardiomegaly
		- Evidence of heart failure
		- Widened mediastinum
# Specific Management

> [!NOTE] 
> - Overly aggressive treatment may cause syncope, cortical blindness with occipital stroke, myocardial ischaemia. Do not treat the BP reading, only treat the complication(s) associated with it
> - Severe hypertension (SBP>180 mmHg) is common in hospitalised patients and usually has no features of a hypertensive emergency and a high reading alone does not require urgent treatment
- Isolated hypertension
	- Exclude end-organ dysfunction: history, examination, urinalysis, ECG, renal function
	- Identify precipitating cause:
		- Non-compliance, incorrect dose, drug interaction
		- Secondary cause (as outlined earlier)
	- Gain control gradually over 48 hours or more using oral antihypertensive medications:
		- Review the patient's current antihypertensive treatment and consider in dose or one-off dose making a clear note in the patient's chart
		- A decision to use a new agent can usually await the patient's regular medical care team (i.e. don't change much on an overnight/on call shift) but can consider among: beta-blockers, diuretics, ACE inhibitors, ARBs, and CCBs
- [[Aortic Dissection#Management|Aortic Dissection Management]]
## Hypertensive Encephalopathy
- Arrange an urgent CT brain scan to exclude alternative causes of confusion (e.g. SAH, space-occupying lesion, intracranial infection or stroke) and consider postictal state or non-convulsive status epilepticus
- Look for evidence of renal disease
	- Check for proteinuria on urinalysis and send a sample for microscopy
- Look for retinal haemorrhages, exudates or papilloedema on fundoscopy
	- If present, the BP should be carefully lowered over the next 2-4 hours; call for senior help
- Aim to initally reduce the MAP by 25% or for a DBP of 100-110 mmHg within the first 24 hours
	- Start oral therapy:
		- Atenolol 50mg, labetalol 100mg, amlodipine 5-10mg or felodipine sustained-release 5-10mg
	- If unsuccessful, give hydralazine 5-10mg slow IV boluses every 15-30 minutes
	- If still unsuccessful, arrange for admission to the ICU
		- In ICU start sodium nitroprusside 0.25-10 mcg/kg/min IV with intra-arterial BP monitoring
- Once controlled, the usual medical team can continue oral therapy to maintain satisfactory BP control
## Catecholamine Crisis
- Consider other presentations with sudden hypertension, headache, diaphoresis, anxiety, palpitations, nausea or abdominal pain which are more likely than phaeochromocytoma:
	- Cocaine, ecstasy and amphetamine misuse
		- In cocaine-induced hypertension, use high-dose titrated benzodiazepines such as diazepam 0.1-0.2mg/kg or midazolam 0.1mg/kg IV
			- Check ECG and measure troponin to exclude myocardial damage
	- Abrupt antihypertensive medication withdrawal (clonidine)
	- Interaction between MAOI and tyramine-containing foods (e.g. cheese or wine) and/or sympthaomimetic or other psychoactive drugs
		- Call senior and transfer to ICU/CCU
		- Phentolamine or nitroprusside may be used by beta-blockers should be avoided because of the risk of unopposed alpha stimulation causing increased BP
- If phaeochromocytoma suspected, call your senior and transfer the patient to the ICU/CCU for ECG and intra-arterial BP monitoring followed by alpha-adrenergic blockade
## Pre-eclampsia and Eclampsia
- The treatment of choice near term is immediate delivery of the baby and magnesium sulfate IV. Call for senior help including the obstetric team, and commence magnesium for any complications:
- Give magnesium sulfate 4 g IV over 10–15 minutes, followed by maintenance infusion 1 g/hour continued for at least 24 hours after delivery.
- Magnesium sulfate does not significantly lower the BP. Therefore, other drugs such as hydralazine or labetalol are given according to local practice.
- Diuretics are avoided as the patient is already volume-depleted from an activated renin–angiotensin system, despite being hypertensive.
