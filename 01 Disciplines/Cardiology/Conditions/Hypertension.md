- Note that it is not the absolute BP level that dictates the need for intervention, but rather the threat to organ dysfunction
# Phone Call/Presentation Questions
- How high is the BP and what has it been previously?
- What was the reason for admission?
- Is the patient pregnant? ⇒ pre-eclampsia
- Does the patient have symptoms suggestive of a hypertensive emergency?
	- Sudden onset chest or back pain ⇒ aortic dissection
	- Chest pain, arrhythmia or dyspnoea ⇒ [[Acute Coronary Syndromes]] and or [[Acute Pulmonary Oedema]]
	- Sudden headache, vomiting, confusion, seizure ⇒ SAH or hypertensive encephalopathy
- What antihypertensive medication has the patient been taking?
- Is the patient taking a MAOI antidepressant
## Instructions Over the Phone
- If features of hypertensive emergency or pregnant:
	- Ask the nurse to stay by the patient's bedside and get help from additional nursing staff
	- Administer oxygen to maintain saturation >94%
	- Attach ECG and pulse oximetry monitoring to the patient
	- Request an IV trolley at the patient's bedside with a selection of cannulae ready for insertion if not already in place
	- If asymptomatic and no abnormal clinical signs, ask the nurse to check the BP again in 10 minutes and call you back with the result
	- Ensure that the patient's regular antihypertensive medication has not been missed recently
- Hypertension associated with acute end-organ damage needs to be seen immediately (hypertensive emergency)
- Hypertension in an asymptomatic patient does not need to be assessed immediately irrespective of how high the BP is; the BP can be safely brought under control over the following hours or days[^1]
# Common Causes *(Corridor Thoughts)*
- Essential hypertension
- Secondary hypertension
	- Obstructive uropathy, renal artery stenosis, chronic pyelonephritis
	- Glomerulonephritis, diabetic renal disease, polycystic kidney disease
	- Endocrine disease such as Cushing's syndrome, Conn's syndrome, acromegaly, thyrotoxicosis, myxoedema
	- Autoimmune disease such as SLE or scleroderma
- Medications
	- Corticosteroids, oral contraceptive pill, NSAIDs
- Catecholamine related
	- Phaeochromacytoma
	- Drug overdose (especially cocaine, amphetamines, ecstasy)
- Medication withdrawal
	- Abrupt withdrawal from a beta-blocker, clonidine or ACE inhibitor resulting in a rebound hypertensive crisis
- Drug interaction
	- MAOI antidepressant in combination with a sympathomimetic or other psychoatcive drug or a food containing tyramine (e.g. cheese or wine)
- Neurogenic
	- Anxiety (e.g. white coat hypertension, unexpected/distressing hospital admission)
	- Raised intracranial pressure (e.g. Cushing's reflex of hypertension and bradycardia)
	- Cerebral ischaemia (e.g stroke)
- Other
	- Preeclampsia
	- Coarctation of the aorta
	- Polycytheaemia
	- Hypercalcaemia
	- Hyperparathyroidism
	- Sleep apnoea
- Other miscellaneous that cause transient ↑ BP: pain, bladder distension, alcohol or nicotine withdrawal, agitation and anxiety
# Assessment
## End of Bed
- The initial appearance often undermines the situation; even a patient with hypertensive encephalopathy may look deceptively well
## A → E Assessment
- Blood pressure? 
	- Retake the blood pressure in both arms (lower pressure in one arm can indicate aortic coarctation)
- Heart rate?
	- Bradycardia and hypertension in a patient not on beta-blockers ⇒ ? ↑ICP
	- Tachycardia and hypertension ⇒ catecholamine related cause
- Respiratory rate?
	- Dyspnoea may indicate pulmonary oedema with acute LVF → listen at lung bases for confirmatory basal crackles
# Immediate Management
- If acutely symptomatic or suggestive of a serious cause:
	- Call for senior help
	- Oxygen to maintain the saturation >94%
	- Attach cardiac monitoring and pulse oximeter to the patient
	- Establish IV access
	- Acute lowering of the BP may be required but only when critical hypertensive emergency is diagnosed
		- The choice of antihypertensive agent otherwise depends on cause of the hypertension, age and medical history
