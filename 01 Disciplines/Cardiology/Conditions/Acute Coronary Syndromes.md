# Risk factors
- Increased risk of ACS with central obesity, autoimmune conditions, chronic renal disease, diabetes and HIV
# Symptoms
- Pain or tightness in chest, jaw, neck, left arm, right arm or epigastrium associated with symptoms of dyspnoea, diaphoresis or fatigue
- Atypical symptoms of myocardial ischaemia occur in women, people with diabetes and the elderly
# Classification
![[Pasted image 20241225161943.png]]
- Other classification
	- Type 1 spontaneous myocardial infarction = atherothrombotic coronary occlusion compromises myocardial blood flow (i.e. heart attack due to coronary plaque rupture)
	- Type 2 myocardial infarction = secondary to ischaemic imbalance between myocardial oxygen suply and/or demand. Can happen due to coronary artery spasm, tachyarrhythmias, bradyarrhythmias, anaemia etc
# STEMI
## ECG STEMI Criteria
- Ongoing chest pain and any of the following:
	- ST elevation of 1mm or more in 2 or more adjancent leads except V2 and V3 which require ST elevation of:
		- 2.5mm or more in men under 40 years
		- 2.0mm or more in men aged 40 years or over
		- 1.5mm or more in women
	- Left bundle branch block and haemodynamically unstable
	- Left bundle branch block and haemodynamically stable with positive modified Sgarbossa criteria
	- Posterior infarct (ST depression V1-V3); needs a posterior ECG to confirm
	- de Winter T waves V2-V5

### Other STEMI
- In patients with inferior STEMI, RV infarction is suggested by:
	- ST elevation in V1
	- ST elevation in V1 and ST depression in V2 (highly specific for RV infarction)
	- Isoelectric ST segment in V1 with marked ST depression in V2
	- ST elevation in III > II
- **Diagnosis is confirmed by the presence of ST elevation in the right-sided leads (V3R-V6R)**
## Management
- Determine if alternate cause of ST elevation (i.e. type 2 MI) and manage that cause accordingly
- Call senior doctor and obtain an urgent cardiology consult
- Move to resuscitation bay or apply defibrillator pads
- Indications for reperfusion therapy for STEMI:
	- Presented to hospital within 12 hours of chest pain/AMI symptoms
	- Or if >12 hours since symptom onset any of:
		- Ongoing ischaemia (e.g. persistent pain and dynamic ECG changes)
		- Viable myocardiam (preservation of R waves in infarct-related ECG leads)
		- Major complications (e.g. cardiogenic shock, heart failure, malignant arrhthymias)
	- Consider advanced care directive and other factors affecting the patient's overall survival (e.g. advanced age, frailty)
- PCI available in <60 minutes[^1]:
	- Request urgent transfer for PCI
	- Anticoagulation before PCI:
		- Aspirin 300mg if not already given as part of [[Chest Pain#Assessment#Initial Assessment (if not done on the phone)|chest pain initial assessment & management]]
		- Heparin 5000 units IV
		- Ticagrelor 180mg PO or Prasugrel 60mg PO preferred otherwise alternatively
			- Clopidogrel 300-600mg PO
		- Ask cardiologist if glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitor is indicated (e.g. eptifibatide, tirofiban)
	- Transfer for PCI
- PCI not available:
	- Check for contraindications to thrombolysis:
		- Symptoms present for more than 12 hours
		- BP >180/110 → treat hypertension (see [[Hypertension]]) and reassess
		- Major trauma or surgery or internal bleeding within one month
		- Ischaemic stroke within 3 months
		- Intracerebral bleed at any time
		- Allergy to tenecteplase
	- Request senior review if relative contraindication to thrombolysis present:
		- Ischaemic stroke >3 months
		- INR >1.8
		- On anticoagulation
		- Bleeding disorder
	- Antiplatelet before thrombolysis
		- Aspirin 300mg if not already given as part of [[Chest Pain#Assessment#Initial Assessment (if not done on the phone)|chest pain initial assessment & management]]
		- Clopidogrel 300mg if <74 years or 75mg if ≥75 years
			- Clopidogrel is preferred for thrombolysis
	- Thrombolysis with tenecteplase, dosage based on weight
			![[Pasted image 20241225154736.png]]
	- Anticoagulation after thrombolysis
			![[Pasted image 20241225154825.png]]
	- Thrombolysis successful if all:
			- ECG >50% reduction in ST elevation
			- Symptoms largely resolved
			- Haemodynamically stable
	- Admit or transfer for PCI depending on local protocols

## Assessment
![[Pasted image 20241225131156.png]]
![[Pasted image 20241225131213.png]]
As from [PASCA ACS Checklist](https://aci.health.nsw.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0020/824141/Pathway-for-Acute-Coronary-syndrome-Assessment-PACSA-Checklist-SAMPLE.pdf)
## Management
- Perform serial ECGs immediately and after 6-8 hours or every 15 minutes if the pain is continuing. Also perform ECG each time a troponin is taken
- Perform high sensitivity troponin at 0 and 2 hours
- Perform standard sensitivity troponin at 6 and 8 hours
- Aspirin 300 mg orally chewed or dissolved before swallowing if not given already
	- 100-150 mg orally daily aspirin
- High clinical risk:
	- Criteria: Any of the following
		- Typical or ongoing symptoms
			- On call makes mention of repetitive or prolonged (>10 min) ongoing chest pain or typical chest pain in patients with diabetes or chronic renal impairment (eGFR <60)
		- Syncope at presentation or SBP <90mmHg
		- Acute onset left ventricular failure
		- Significant arrhythmia (2nd or 3rd degree AV block or VT)
		- AMI, PCI or CABG in last 6 months
		- Dynamic ECG: ST (>0.5mm up or down) or new T wave inversion
		- Initial and repeat troponin positive with no non-ischaemic cause of troponin elevation
	- Management
		- If STEMI changes follow [[Acute Coronary Syndromes#STEMI#Management|STEMI Management as above]]
		- Commence high-flow oxygen if shocked or hypoxic
		- Give aspirin 300mg PO if not done so already
		- Contact senior doctor immediately, then the cardiology registrar
			- Give prasugrel 60mg PO (then 10mg OD), ticagrelor 180mg PO (then 90mg BD) or clopidogrel 300mg PO (then 75mg OD) as indicated by senior/reg
			- Cardiology team will advise heparin anticoagulation; suitable options include
				- LMWH if renal function allows
					![[Pasted image 20241225170355.png]]
				- UFH; ask senior for advice
			- Cardiology will advise of use of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors (e.g. eptifibatide or tirofiban) if immediate access to cath lab is not available
		- Admit with cardiac monitoring (preferably to CCU) for consideration of angiography within next 48 hours[^2]
		- Admitting team will advise:
			- Anticoagulation
			- Antiplatelet therapy
			- Beta blockers
			- Statins
- Intermediate risk
	- Criteria: Doesn't meet high or low risk criteria
	- Management
		- Give aspirin 300mg PO if not done so already
		- Call senior doctor and refer to inpatient medical registrar
		- Repeat ECG and troponin at 6-8 hours
		- Admit without cardiac monitoring or discharge after senior review with follow up with GP/Cardiologist in one week
		- Usually require exercise stress testing ideally within 72 hours to further categorise into EST-positive and EST-negative 
- Low risk
	- Criteria: Symptom free with non-ischaemic ECGs and ALL of the following:
		- Age <45
		- Symptoms atypical for angina
		- no known coronary artery disease
	- Management
		- Treat other diagnoses
		- Give aspirin 300mg PO if not done so already
		- Review precipitating cause of angina (e.g. anaemia, aortic stenosis, thyrotoxicosis and HCM) and ECG
		- If known diagnosis of angina
			- Determine if threshold for angina has decreased or the severity of pain increased
			- Consult with senior for adjustment to antianginal medication
			- If episode was prolonged or worse with no easily fixable precipitant repeat troponin and ECG at 6-8 hours
		- Follow up with GP or cardiology outpatient
		- Exercise stress testing, echo, cardiac perfusion and CTA **NOT** usually indicated[^3]

# Other Management
## Recurrent Pain
- Recurrent episodes of ischaemic chest pain may require GTN infusion for a short period of time; prolonged infusion rapidly induces tolerance
	- GTN 10 micrograms/minute by IV infusion increasing by 10 micrograms/minute every 3 minutes until pain is controlled provided systolic blood pressure ≥95 mmHg
