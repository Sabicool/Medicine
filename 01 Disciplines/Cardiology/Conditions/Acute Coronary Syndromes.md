# STEMI
## Management
- Morphine
- Oxygen
- Nitrates
- Antiplatelets
- Save tissue
- Heparin

- Position the patient in the position of comfort
- Airway
	- Maintain airway patency; see [[Acute Airway Failure]]
- Breathing
	- Assist ventilation
	- Consider oxygen if dyspnoeic titrating oxygen to maintain Sp$\ce{O2}$ >93% unless $\ce{CO2}$ retainer, in which case aim for Sp$\ce{O2}$ 88-92%
- For possible STEMI or other high-risk ACS with haemodynamic compromise, move patient to the resuscitation area and/or attach patient to a defibrillator
- Circulation
	- Cardiac ryhthym
		- Attach cardiac monitor and 12 lead ECG within 10 minutes of clinical contact
	- Perfusion, pulse blood pressure
		- Give aspirin 300mg orally (chew or dissolve in water) unless already given or contraindicated
		![[Pasted image 20241223210632.png]]
	- Establish IV access
	- Examine for signs of shock: (tachcardia and CRT ≥3 seconds) and/or abnormal skin perfusion and/or hypotension
		- If shock (as above) and/or SBP <90mmHg give 250mL of 0.9% saline bolus
		- Monitor patients with CCF for signs of fluid overload
- Disability
	- Measure GCS
	- Manage pain (see [[Pain Management]])
		- Mild: paracetamol 1000mg oral
		- Moderate: (+paracetamol 1000mg oral)
			- Oxycodone
				- 16-65 years: 5mg oral, repeat if required after 30 minutes, max dose 10mg
				- ≥65 years: 2.5mg oral, repeat after 30 minutes, max dose 5mg
		- Severe: (do not give morphine or fentanyl if SBP <100mmHg)
			- Morphine IV
				- 16-65 years: 5mg IV, repeat if required after 5 minutes, max dose 10mg
				- ≥65 years: 2.5mg IV, repeat if required after 5 minutes, max dose 5mg
			- OR Fentanyl IV
				- 16-65 years: 50mcg IV, repeat after 5 minutes, max dose 100 mcg
				- ≥65 years: 25mcg IV, repeat after 5 minutes, max dose 50mcg
- Exposure
	- Measure temperature
- Fluids
	- Commence fluid balance chart as required
	- Manage nausea and vomiting
		- metoclopramide 10 mg orally **or** IV/IM once only (over 20 years only)
		- **or** ondansetron 4 mg orally **or** IV/IM. If symptoms persist after 60 minutes, repeat once, maximum dose 8 mg
		- **or** prochlorperazine 5 mg orally once only **or** 12.5 mg IV/IM once only
- Glucose
	- Measure BGL
	- If BGL<4mmol/L and NO ↓LOC → give sugary drink
	- If BGL<4mmol/L and ↓LOC → glucose 10% 200mL by infusion over 15 minutes once only or glucagon 1mg IM
