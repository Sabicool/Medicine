# Assessment
- Blood cultures
	- Take blood cultures before starting antibiotic therapy
	- Take at least 3 sets of blood cultures (take 2 sets immediately and take the third set at least 1 hour later[^1])
	- Blood cultures should ideally be taken from 3 separate venipuncture sites to avoid any misdiagnosis
- Arrange an echocardiogram for patients with suspected infective endocarditis
	- TOEs are significantly more sensitive in the diagnosis of infective endocarditis than TTE
	- TOEs are particularly more sensitive for prosthetic valve and cardiac implantable electronic device associated endocarditis
# Management
- Early involvement of cardiologist, infectious disease physician and cardiac surgeon
- Empirical antibiotic therapy
	- Standard regimen for native valve infective endocarditis
		- Benzylpenicillin 1.8 g intravensouly, 4-hourly (or if MRSA suspected, use vancomycin) and
		- Flucloxacillin 2 g intravenously 4-hourly and
		- Gentamicin intravenously
	- Standard regimen for prosthetic valve infective endocarditis
		- Vancomycin intravenously and
		- Flucloxacillin 2 g intravenously, 4-hourly
		- Gentamicin intravenosuly
# Prevention
- A sample of valve tissue should be taken for culture at the time of valve surgery for endocarditis
	- If positive or if culture was not obtained, give postoperative antibiotic treatment for 4-6 weeks
	- If negative give postoperative antibiotic treatment for the recommended duration or at least 2 weeks, which is longer

[^1]: In patients with sepsis or septic shock, all 3 sets of blood cultures should ideally be taken over a short time period before starting antibiotics
