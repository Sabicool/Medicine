# Presentation
- Pain is sharp, retrosternal and radiates to the back; worse on inspiration, swallowing or lying down and relieved by sitting up
- Pericardial rub best heard along the left sternal edge in expiration with the patient sitting up; but may be transient
- Pericarditis 2° TB, uraemia or neoplastic disease is more insidious and ±pain; patients present with insidious pericardial tamponade
# Diagnosis
- Diagnosed when ≥2 of the following:
	- Pericarditic chest pain
	- Pericardial rubs on auscultation
	- New widespread ST elevation or PR depression on ECG
	- Pericardial effusion (new or worsening)
- ![[Pasted image 20250419231258.jpg]]
# Management
- Attach cardiac monitoring and pulse oximeter to the patient
- Send bloods for FBC, UEC, LFTs, troponin and viral serology
	- CRP, ESR and WCC may be raised as markers of inflammation
- ECG may show:
	- Sinus tachycardia alone
	- Widespread concave ST elevation or PR-segment depression
	- Later T waves may flatten or become symmetrically inverted
	- May show features of pericardial effusion:
		- Decreased voltages
		- Electrical alternans
- Request CXR
	- Normal usually
- Transthoracic echocardiogram
	- Arrange an urgent echocardiogram and pericardiocentesis if signs of cardiac tamponade:
		- Tachycardia
		- Hypotension
		- Pulsus paradoxus
		- Raised JVP that rises on inspiration
	- Otherwise echocardiogram organised electively[^1]
- Admit the patient if a treatable cause is found or if any of the following:
	- High fever >38°C
	- Large pericardial effusion
	- Cardiac tamponade
	- Failure to respond within 7 days to drug therapy
	- Other considerations that might influence admission: myopericarditis, immunosuppression, trauma and oral anticoagulant therapy
- Specific management if appropriate (e.g. connective tissue disorder → immunosuppression, uraemia → dialysis)
-  Non-pharm
	- Restrict exercise
- Pharm
	- Colchicine; does not need tapering to stop
	- NSAID (usually aspirin) for 1-2 weeks as guided by symptom resolution and normalisation of inflammatory markers; consider tapering to stop

> [!Warning] 
> Must distinguish from [[Acute Coronary Syndromes#STEMI|STEMI]] because thrombolysis is contraindicated in pericarditis due to risk of bleeding from haemorrhagic transformation

[^1]: eTG suggests to arrange a TTE for all patients with pericarditis, but on call only suggests to arrange for patients with suspected pericardial effusion
