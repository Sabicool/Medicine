# Management
- Treatment of narrow-complex SVT is the same, irrespective of whether WPW is present (unlike SVT with aberrancy i.e. wide complex SVT))
	- A broad-complex SVT with aberrancy from ventricular pre-excitation such as in WPW is treated the same as VT
- Unstable SVT: SVT with hypotension chest pain (angina), SOB (LV failure) or an altered mental state
	- Call for senior help
	- Apply high-flow oxygen by mask and gain IV access
	- Attach the ECG monitor/defibrillator to the patient and confirm the rhythm
	- Prepare procedural sedation such as propofol 200mg in 20mL IV and call an anaesthetist
	- Once senior assistance is present, the treatment of choice is synchronised DC cardioversion beginning with 70-120J (biphasic) repeated up to three times
- Stable SVT
	- Vagal manoeuvres
		- Valsalva maneuvre: 
			1. Place the patient in the Trendelenburg (foot of the bed up) position on a trolley
			2. Ask the patient to blow into the nozzle end of a 20 mL syringe for 10 seconds to try to force the plunger halfway up, then release suddenly
		- Carotid sinus massage
			- Check precautions below
			- Turn the patient's head to left and locate the carotid sinus just anterior to the sternocleidomastoid at the level of the top of the thyroid cartilage

			- Feel the carotid pulsation at this point and apply steady pressure to the carotid artery with two fingers for 10-15 seconds; try the right side and if this is not effective then try the left side (never perform bilateral massage)
		- Drug therapy
			- Adenosine
				- Precautions in patients with COPD and asthma as it may precipitate wheeze and reduce dose in patients on dipyridamole
				- Warn the patients of side effects as they are common and often poorly tolerated but are transient:
					- Feeling of impending doom, also facial flushing, dyspnoea and chest pressure
				- Make sure ECG monitoring 
				- 6mg as a rapid IV bolus followed by a 20mL saline flush
				- If ineffective increase to adenosine 12mg IV push and repeat after 1-2 minutes if still no response
			- Verapamil
				- Verapamil 2.5-5mg IV over 1-2 minutes repeated every 5-10 minutes to a total dose of 15mg
					- Verapamil may cause hypotension if injected too rapidly, so give slowly, particularly in the elderly
					- It has a negative ionotropic effect
				- **Never give verapamil after a beta-blocker, when digoxin toxicity is suspected or if the patient has a wide-complex tachycardia; can cause fatal bradycardia**
				- If SVT still persists following verapamil, repeat the vagal manoeuvres

> [!WARNING] Carotid Sinus Massage Precautions
> Always perform carotid sinus massage with IV atropine 600mcg available and continuous ECG monitoring as some patients develop asystole
> In some patients carotid sinus massage has resulted in stroke from carotid artery stenosis. Always listen over each carotid artery for bruit. Do not perform if there is any of:
> - Carotid bruit or known carotid artery stenosis >50%
> - TIA, stroke or AMI in past 3 months
> - History of symptomatic bradyarrhythmias
