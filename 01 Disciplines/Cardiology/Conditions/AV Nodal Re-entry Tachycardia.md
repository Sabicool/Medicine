  - AVNRT
---
- More common in women than men
# Clinical Presentation
- Sudden onset of rapid, regular palpitations
- Associated symptoms:
	- Presyncope or syncope due to a transient fall in blood pressure
	- Chest pain (esp. if underlying coronary artery disease)
	- Dyspnoea
	- Anxiety
	- Polyuria from elevated atrial pressure causing release of atrial natriuretic peptide
# Pathophysiology
*The following is the pathophysiology for the 'slow-fast' varient of AVNRT*

- Requires:
	- Slow conducting pathway (alpha) with a short refractory period
	- Fast conducting pathway (beta) with a long refractory period
1. PAC arrives while fast pathway is refractory and goes down the slow pathway
2. When the effective refractory period in the alpha pathway ends, the impulse travels retrogradely up the fast pathway
3. Impulse continually cycles around the two pathways
