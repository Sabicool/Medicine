# Management
## Acute Management of Rapid Ventricular Response
- Unstable: AF with hypotension, altered mental status, chest pain (angina) or SOB (LV failure)
	- DC cardioversion beginning with 120-150 J biphasic provided that the AF is of recent onset (<48h)
	- A patient on digoxin therapy may require temporary transcutaneous pacing, as asystole can follow DC reversion
- Stable
	- Duration <48 hours: Rhythm control with drugs or electrical cardioversion
		- 50-60% of patients will spontaneously revert within 24 hours anyway, so observation may be all that is needed when the AF has been present for ≤12 hours
		- Correct hypokalaemia with 20 mmol potassium in 500 mL 5% dextrose over 30 minutes
		- Correct hypomagnesaemia (particularly in alcoholics) with magnesium sulfate 10 mmol (2.5 g) IV
		- Give amiodarone 300 mg IV over 30 minutes, followed by an infusion of amiodarone 900 mg over 24 hours. This is effective in up to 75% of patients. Continuous ECG monitoring is required.
			- Note: although flecainide and sotalol are more effective than amiodarone, they have dangerous side effects, including hypotension, and mandate senior advice before use
		- Commence heparinisation with a LMWH such as enoxaparin 1 mg/kg SC 12-hourly, or UFH 5000 U IV as a bolus, followed by an infusion commencing at 1000 U/h
		- Perform electrical cardioversion is above measures are unsuccessful
	- Duration >48 hours or time duration is unclear: Rate control only
		- Do not attempt cardioversion prior to full anticoagulation
		- Commence heparinisation with LMWH (e.g. enoxaparin) or UFH
		- Perform rate control using PO or IV beta-blocker, digoxin, diltiazem or magnesium
			- Continuous ECG monitoring is required when any agent is given IV (consider CCU care)
			- If the patient is completely asymptomatic or the AF has been present for several days
		- If patient has normal LV function (no past history or current evidence of LV failure or ↓ EF) give:
			- Metoprolol 2.5mg slow IV boluses up to a total dose of 10mg followed by 25-50mg twice a day thereafter
		- If the patient has documented or suspected depressed LV function give:
			- Digoxin 0.5mg slowly IV or PO repeated in 8 hours followed by 0.125-0.25mg PO daily thereafter
	- Atrial fibrillation wit a ventricular rate <100 beats/min
		- AF <100 beats/min in an untreated patient suggests underlying AV nodal dysfunction ⇒ do not require immediate rate or rhythm control unless haemodynamically compromised (e.g. hypotension, chest pain or LV failure)
			- Start these patients on anticoagulation if no contraindications
## Acute Management of Slow Ventricular Response
- Does not require treatment unless the patient is hypotensive or has symptoms of vital organ hypoperfusion (e.g. syncope, confusion angina or LVF)
- Definitive treatment includes discontinuation of any drug that depresses cardiac conduction and consideration for temporary or permanent pacemaker placement
