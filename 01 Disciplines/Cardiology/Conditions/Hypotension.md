-  If considering that the patient is in shock see shock notes: [Shock](01%20Disciplines/Clinical/Emergencies/Shock.md)
- Note that it is not the absolute BP level that dictates the need to intervention but rather the threat to end-organ function; therefore the **priority is to assess for tissue hypoperfusion**
- Thin young females often have a SBP of 80-100 mmHg
# Phone Call/Presentation Questions
- Normal blood pressure? and other observations (notably HR and RR)
- Reason for patient's admission?
- Is the patient symptomatic?
	- Mental status?
	- Clammy or pale?
	- Dyspnoea or chest pain?
	- Evidence of bleeding?
	- Temperature?
- Recent medication (in last hour)?
## Instructions Over the Phone
- If possibility of shock:
	- Administer ≥6L/min by oxygen by mask and attach pulse oximetry to the patient
	- Request an IV trolley at the patient's bedside with two large-bore 14-16G cannulae ready for insertion (if IV lines not already in place)
	- Give 20 mL/kg normal saline IV as rapidly as possible unless the patient is SOB and may have pulmonary oedema with cardiogenic shock
	- Request ECG immediately and commence continuous cardiac monitoring
	- Organise cross matching of ≥4 units of packed RBCs if the admission diagnosis was GI bleed or if there is evidence of external blood loss
	- Request 1:1000 adrenaline 0.01mg/kg up to 0.5mg (0.5mL) be drawn up ready for IM injection into the upper lateral thigh if you suspect lateral thigh if you suspect anaphylaxis
	- Arrange portable CXR immediately if the patient has dyspnoea or chest pain

# Common Causes *(Corridor thoughts)*
- Dehydration
- Medications (often postural hypotension)
	- Antihypertensives, nitrates, sedatives, analgesics
- Autonomic neuropathy
	- Diabetes, Parkinson's disease/Parkinson plus syndromes
- Physiological
- Iatrogenic
- [[Shock]]
	- Distributive
	- Cardiogenic
	- Hypovolemic
	- Obstructive
# Assessment
## Bedside
- Evaluate the patient from the bedside: do they actually look sick or critical
	- The patient may be pale, agitated and sweaty
## A → E Assessment
- **A**irway clear?
	- If the patient has depressed consciousness, intubation may be required; contact senior urgently as well as duty anaesthetist and ICU
	- Consider intubation and roll patient into the left lateral decubitus position to avoid aspiration; remove loose-fitting dentures
- **B**reathing pattern? 
	- Tachypnoea is common and may indicate lactic acidosis secondary to tissue hypoperfusion, acute LVF or underlying PE, pneumothorax or cardiac tamponade
- **C**ardiovascular: 
	- Blood pressure?
		- Measure supine blood pressure in *both* arms
		- Automated NIBP is notoriously inaccurate at low readings; retake blood pressure manually
		- If the blood pressure is now returned to normal it could have been caused by a vasovagal episode or orthostatic hypotension
		- If hypotension is not severe and the patient appears well, examine for postural vital signs (not needed if hypotensive when supine)
			- Ask for assistance if the patient is unable to stand alone or have the patient sit up over the edge of the bed
			- Repeat HR and BP after they sit or stand for ≥2 minutes and ask the patient if they feel unwell or light-headed
				- HR ↑ >20 beats/min or patient reported light headedness is an indicator of inadequate intravascular volume
	- Pulse Pressure?
		- Narrow pulse pressure means low LV stroke volume and shock
		- Wide pulse pressure means [Anaphylaxis](01%20Disciplines/Immunology/Emergencies/Anaphylaxis.md) or [Septicaemia](01%20Disciplines/Infectious%20Disease/Conditions/Septicaemia.md) (i.e. warm shock)
	- Heart Rate?
		- Low volume or impalpable peripheral pulses indicates hypoperfusion
		- Hypotension usually accompanied by compensatory reflex sinus tachycardia
		- Look at the ECG
			- HR <50 beats/min ⇒ vasovagal episode, autonomic neuropathy, rate-slowing drugs, [[Arrhythmias#Bradyarrhythmias|bradyarrhythmia]], or haemorrhagic shock (haemorrhagic shock can have bradycardia sometimes)
			- HR >150 beats/min and evidence of VT, AF with RVR or SVT electrical cardioversion [[Arrhythmias#Immediate Management|see: Tachyarrhythmia immediate management]]
			- Other ECG abnormalities can indicate drug toxicity or electrolyte abnormality or 2° to the hypotension
- **D**isability:
	- Is the patient orientated?
	- GCS?
	- Pupils?
	- BSL?
- **E**nvironment
	- Febrile/Temperature?
		- Consider sepsis with >38°C or <36°C but be aware of normal temperature sepsis in the elderly and immunosuppressed
		- Hypothermia can also result secondary to shock
	- Abdomen?
## Initial Examination: Is the Patient in Shock?
- This targeted examination aims to identify with the patient is in shock?

# Immediate Management
- Call senior immediately
- Commence oxygen therapy to maintain saturation >94%
- Obtain adequate IV access
	- Two large bore 14-16G cannulae in large peripheral veins  (antecubital veins preferred)
	- Send bloods for FBC, UEC, coagulation profile and troponin if the ECG is abnormal
	- Check VBG including lactate
	- Request immediate cross match of 2-6 units of packed RBCs if haemorrhage is suspected
- Resuscitate intravascular depletion
	- Give 20mL/kg normal saline IV over 10 minutes if the patient is hypotensive, JVP is low and there is no crackles on chest auscultation
	- Elevate or squeeze IV bag or use IV pressure cuffs
	- Observe response to fluid challenge by monitoring HR, BP, JVP, peripheral perfusion, basal lung crackles and urine output; repeat 20mL/kg as clinically indicated
		- Titrate fluid resuscitation carefully in a patient with a history of cardiac failure and commence with a smaller fluid bolus of 5mL/kg
		- Ensure all patients who are bleeding maintain a Hb >90-100
- Treat any immediately apparent cause
	- Give adrenaline 0.3-0.5mg (0.3-0.5mL of 1:1000) IM for anaphylaxis
	- Broad-spectrum antibiotics for septicaemia
- Insert IDC to monitor urine output (0.5-1 mL/kg/h ⇒ restoration of adequate renal perfusion)
- 12-lead ECG and review the rhythm strip
	- Give IV atropine bolus (0.5-1.0mg) if HR <50
	- Perform DC cardioversion with appropriate sedation if HR>150 beats/min with hypotension and VT, AF RVR or SVT (see [[Arrhythmias#Immediate Management|Tachyarrhythmias management]])
- Request portable CXR
# Selective History and Chart Review
- Determine whether a presenting problem or past medical history is a cause of the hypotension and review chart for trends or medication changes
- Risk factors for hypovolaemic or distributive shock
	- Bleeding, concealed bleeding (e.g. AAA, ectopic pregnancy, pelvic or long-bone fracture)
	- Vomiting/diarrhoea
	- Bowel obstruction, ileus or pancreatitis (third space fluid losses)
	- Burns or generalised erythroderma
	- Fevers, rigors, malaise, recent contact with meningococcal disease
	- Ask female patients about abdominal pain with vaginal bleeding or the use of tampons (⇒ toxic shock syndrome)
- Risk factors for cardiogenic or obstructive shock
	- Chest pain, dyspnoea, orthopnoea, previous ACS or cardiac interventions ⇒ cardiogenic shock
	- For patients with diabetes or chronic renal impairment consider silent myocardial ischaemia and cardiogenic shock
	- Pleuritic chest pain, whole leg swelling, known malignancy or renal failure ⇒ PE or pericardial tamponade
- Reason for admission
- HxPC:
	- Chest pain, SOB
	- Pre-syncope
	- Thirsty?
	- When last void?
- PMHx
- Charts
	- Observation chart
		- See whether there has been a slow deterioration or sudden change
		- Check the temperature chart for fever
		- Look for a change in weight as loss of weight can indicate fluid loss
	- Fluid balance chart
		- Look for evidence of hypovolaemia:
			- Reduced PO or IV intake
			- Excessive fluid loss from NG or surgical drains or ileostomies
			- Urine output <30mL/h
		- Check for recent excessive urinary loss from diuretic medications, osmotic diuresis (hyperglycaemia, mannitol administration, hypertonic IV contrast material), post-obstructive renal diuresis, diabetes insipidus, recovery phase of acute tubular necrosis, adrenal insufficiency with vomiting
	- Medication chart
		- Note any recent change in dose or addition of hypotension-inducing medications
			- Antihypertensive medications and alpha-blockers (e.g. antipsychotic medications) lower BP excessively
			- Beta blockers, calcium channel blockers and other antiarrhythmics cause hypotension and counter a reflex tachycardia
			- Diuretics cause hypovolaemia
			- Excessive doses of analgesics or sedatives cause hypotension
			- Recent administration of radiographic contrast may precipitate anaphylaxis
			- NSAIDs and steroids can precipitate GI bleeding and anticoagulants worsen any bleeding
# Examination
- Peripheral CRT, skin turgor
- Pallor of the palmar creases
- JVP
- Heart sounds
- Calves

> [!NOTE] 
> Patients with acute cardiogenic shock are note oedematous unless they have previous CCF. Patients with anaphylaxis or sepsis may become oedematous from capillary leakage
# Investigations
- Investigations
	- Note other charts:
		- Fluid charts
		- Medication charts: (e.g. antihypertensives)
	- Bloods
	- Imaging
- Check recent Hb for trends
- VBG might show lactic acidosis or hyperkalaemia from low tissue perfusion
- Urea to creatinine ratio: a ratio >12 is suggestive of volume depletion or a GI bleed
- Urine sample for MCS if dipstick testing indicates potential urosepsis
- Review CXR
	- Acute LVF: pulmonary venous congestion, cardiomegaly, Kerley B lines (ABCDE features)
	- Aortic dissection: widened mediastinum (see [[Aortic Dissection#Management|Aortic Dissection Management for specific CXR fidnings]])
	- Pulmonary embolism: plate atelactasis, basal effusion
	- Pneumonia: consolidation, diffuse alveolar changes
- Echocardiography
	- Will confirm pericardial tamponade or right ventricular strain of PE 
	- Hard to organise after hours
# Specific Management
- Cardiogenic shock
	- Clinically manifested by hypotension, elevated JVP and pulmonary oedema
	- Treat ACS-related causes (see [[Acute Coronary Syndromes|ACS]])
		- After giving aspirin, heparin and clopidogrel or prasugrel refer for immediate PCI
		- *Fibrinolytic therapy does not substantially improve the outcome in cardiogenic shock*[^1]
		- Exclude other causes of hypotension with raised JVP using urgent echocardiogram
		- Also perform urgent echocardiogram in patients with a new murmur as valve repair my be required
	- Inferior STEMI
		- Confirm RV infarction by placing right sided chest leads (usually just V4R but sometimes also with V5R and V6R)
		- STE indicates RV infarction
		- These patients are dependent on preload for their cardiac output so avoid dropping preload with GTN, morphine or diuretics
		- Less likely to develop pulmonary oedema → try small aliquots of normal saline at 2 mL/kg
	- Exclude aortic dissection causing shock from tamponade or severe aortic incompetence
		- Arrange CT scan with IV contrast (CT angiography) or TOE to best distinguish [[Aortic Dissection]] from [[Acute Coronary Syndromes|ACS]]
	- General measures of shock
		- Give maximal oxygenation, careful fluid management and consider inotrope infusions such as noradrenaline with or without dobutamine in the ICU.
		- If these measures are unsuccessful, intra-aortic balloon pump, left ventricular assist device (LVAD) or circulatory bypass are required if a reversible pathological feature is present and it is available

^cardiogenic-shock-management

- Hypovolaemic Shock
	- Control external bleeding: compress or pack any external haemorrhage such as epixstaxis or an open wound
	- Consult surgeon immediately if suspicion of acute blood loss causing hypotension (e.g. GI bleed, ruptured AAA, ectopic pregnancy)
	- Massive bleeding
		- Order uncross-matched blood and consider other blood products such as FFP and platelets
		- notify the blood bank that a massive transfusion is/may be necessary
	- Excess fluid loss via vomiting, diarrhoea, sweating, polyuria, extreme diuretic therapy and third-space losses (e.g. pancreatitis, bowel obstruction, peritonitis) → replace intravascular volume with normal saline
		- Give 20-40mL/kg normal saline
		- Gradually correct the dehydration and include daily maintenance amounts
		- Search for underlying cause
- Anaphylaxis
	- Treat immediately with adrenaline 0.3-0.5mg (0.3-0.5mL of 1:1000 solution) IM plus normal saline 20mL/kg (see [[Acute Airway Failure#Management|Airway Failure Management]])
- Septic Shock
	- Arrange a CXR and urinalysis/MSU as initial screens; make sure at least two sets of paired blood cultures from two different sites have been sent
	- Examine all areas of the skin looking for a source or entry sites including between the toes, skin folds, perineum, axillae and the ENT for localised infections
	- Consider toxic shock syndrome in any hypotensive premenopausal female particularly with blanching erythema like sunburn; ask about tampon use (now a rare cause)
	- Intravascular fluid resuscitation requires large volumes: up to 50-100mL/kg
	- Ensure Hb is maintained between 70 and 90g/L
	- Patients who are neutropenic (e.g. chemotherapy, diabetes, HIV, immunosuppressed) show few signs of sepsis
		- Give broad-spectrum antibiotics such as piperacillin 4g with tazobactam 0.5g IV plus gentamicin 4-7mg/kg
		- Add vancomycin 1.5 IV 12 hourly if line sepsis is possible
- Other causes of hypotension
	- Tension pneumothorax
		- Do not wait for X-ray confirmation in an unstable patient
		- Call for senior assistance and get a 14-16G cannula ready to insert into the second intercostal space in the midclavicular line on the affected side
		- Will result in immediate improvement in blood pressure if done properly
		- Follow with insertion of a chest tube
	- Cardiac tamponade
		- Suspect when elevated JVP, hypotension and soft heart sounds (Beck's triad) with agitation related to intracerebral venous congestion
		- Urgent bedside ultrasound now best confirms the diagnosis
		- Most commonly follows penetrating trauma or is non-traumatic in a patient with chronic renal impairment, malignancy, connective tissue disorders
			- Traumatic → requires immediate surgery
			- Pericardiocentesis with insertion of a catheter into the pericardial sac and aspiration of fluid should result in immediate improvement in non-traumatic cases
	- Massive pulmonary embolism
		- Sudden hypotension, elevated JVP and cyanosis accompanied by additional evidence of acute RV overload such as RV heave, loud P2, right sided S3 or mumur of tricuspid insufficiency
		- See [[Pulmonary Embolism#Management|PE management]]
	- Drug toxicity
		- Common drugs causing hypotension: GTN, vasodilators, opioids, sedatives, antiarrhythmics, beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers and ACE inhibitors
		- Place the patient flat, elevate the legs and give 5-10 mL/kg IV of normal saline to support the BP until the effect of the drug wears off
		- Bradycardia and hypotension from excessive narcotic are reversed by naloxone hydrochloride 0.1-0.2 mg IV, SC or IM every 5 minutes repeated until alert
		- Reduce the dose or alter the schedule of the opioid
	- Vasovagal syncope
		- Usually normotensive by the time you arrive but will still fell nauseated and miserable
		- Warn the patient of continuing to feel faint for several hours afterwards
		- Look for a precipitating stimulus such as pain or exposure to blood with prodromal light-headedness and sweating
		- Ensure no underlying exacerbating factors (e.g. dehydration, infections) as there is no specific treatment
# Complications
- Be wary of post-shock complications over the next few days in hypotensive patients who are successfully resuscitated
	- Multiorgan failure, thrombotic stroke, watershed cortical infarction, diffuse myocardial injury, acute tubular necrosis, hepatic necrosis, bowel ischaemia or infarction
