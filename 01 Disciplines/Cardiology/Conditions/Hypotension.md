 If considering that the patient is in shock see shock notes: [Shock](01%20Disciplines/Clinical/Emergencies/Shock.md)
- Thin young females often have a SBP of 80-100 mmHg
# Phone Call/Presentation Questions
- Normal blood pressure? and other observations (notably HR and RR)
- Reason for patient's admission?
- Is the patient symptomatic?
	- Mental status?
	- Clammy or pale?
	- Dyspnoea or chest pain?
	- Evidence of bleeding?
	- Temperature?
- Recent medication (in last hour)?
## Instructions Over the Phone
- If possibility of shock:
	- Administer ≥6L/min by oxygen by mask and attach pulse oximetry to the patient
	- Request an IV trolley at the patient's bedside with two large-bore 14-16G cannulae ready for insertion (if IV lines not already in place)
	- Give 20 mL/kg normal saline IV as rapidly as possible unless the patient is SOB and may have pulmonary oedema with cardiogenic shock
	- Request ECG immediately and commence continuous cardiac monitoring
	- Organise cross matching of ≥4 units of packed RBCs if the admission diagnosis was GI bleed or if there is evidence of external blood loss
	- Request 1:1000 adrenaline 0.01mg/kg up to 0.5mg (0.5mL) be drawn up ready for IM injection into the upper lateral thigh if you suspect lateral thigh if you suspect anaphylaxis
	- Arrange portable CXR immediately if the patient has dyspnoea or chest pain

# Common Causes *(Corridor thoughts)*
- Dehydration
- Medications (often postural hypotension)
	- Antihypertensives, nitrates, sedatives, analgesics
- Autonomic neuropathy
	- Diabetes, Parkinson's disease/Parkinson plus syndromes
- Physiological
- Iatrogenic
- [[Shock]]
	- Distributive
	- Cardiogenic
	- Hypovolemic
	- Obstructive
# Assessment
## Bedside
- Evaluate the patient from the bedside: do they actually look sick or critical
	- The patient may be pale, agitated and sweaty
## A → E Assessment
- **A**irway clear?
	- If the patient has depressed consciousness, intubation may be required; contact senior urgently as well as duty anaesthetist and ICU
	- Consider intubation and roll patient into the left lateral decubitus position to avoid aspiration; remove loose-fitting dentures
- **B**reathing pattern? 
	- Tachypnoea is common and may indicate lactic acidosis secondary to tissue hypoperfusion, acute LVF or underlying PE, pneumothorax or cardiac tamponade
- **C**ardiovascular: 
	- Blood pressure?
		- Measure supine blood pressure in *both* arms
		- Automated NIBP is notoriously inaccurate at low readings; retake blood pressure manually
		- If the blood pressure is now returned to normal it could have been caused by a vasovagal episode or orthostatic hypotension
		- If hypotension is not severe and the patient appears well, examine for postural vital signs (not needed if hypotensive when supine)
			- Ask for assistance if the patient is unable to stand alone or have the patient sit up over the edge of the bed
			- Repeat HR and BP after they sit or stand for ≥2 minutes and ask the patient if they feel unwell or light-headed
				- HR ↑ >20 beats/min or patient reported light headedness is an indicator of inadequate intravascular volume
	- Pulse Pressure?
		- Narrow pulse pressure means low LV stroke volume and shock
		- Wide pulse pressure means [Anaphylaxis](01%20Disciplines/Immunology/Emergencies/Anaphylaxis.md) or [Septicaemia](01%20Disciplines/Infectious%20Disease/Conditions/Septicaemia.md) (i.e. warm shock)
	- Heart Rate?
		- Low volume or impalpable peripheral pulses indicates hypoperfusion
		- Hypotension usually accompanied by compensatory reflex sinus tachycardia
- **D**isability:
	- Is the patient orientated?
	- GCS?
	- Pupils?
	- BSL?
- **E**nvironment
	- Febrile?
	- Abdomen?
## History
- Reason for admission
- HxPC:
	- Chest pain, SOB
	- Pre-syncope
	- Thirsty?
	- When last void?
- PMHx
## Examination
- Peripheral CRT, skin turgor
- Pallor of the palmar creases
- JVP
- Heart sounds
- Calves
- Investigations
	- Note other charts:
		- Fluid charts
		- Medication charts: (e.g. antihypertensives)
	- Bloods
	- Imaging
