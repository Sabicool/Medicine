 If considering that the patient is in shock see shock notes: [[Shock]]
- Thin young females often have a SBP of 80-100 mmHg
# Assessment
## Bedside and Vitals
- Evaluate the patient from the bedside: do they actually look sick or critical
	- The patient may be pale, agitated and sweaty
- A to E assessment
	- **A**irway clear? Consider intubation and roll patient into the left lateral decubitus position to avoid aspiration; remove loose-fitting dentures
	- **B**reathing: Tachypnoea is common and may indicate lactic acidosis secondary to tissue hypoperfusion, acute LVF or underlying PE, pneumothorax or cardiac tamponade
	- **C**ardiovascular: Measure supine blood pressure in *both* arms
		- Automated NIBP is notriously inaccurate; retake blood pressure manually
		- *Pulse Pressure?*
			- Narrow pulse pressure means low LV stroke volume and shock
			- Wide pulse pressure means [Anaphylaxis](01%20Disciplines/Immunology/Conditions/Anaphylaxis.md) or [Septicaemia](01%20Disciplines/Infectious%20Disease/Conditions/Septicaemia.md) (i.e. warm shock)
		- *Heart Rate?*
			- Low volume or impalpable peripheral pulses indicates hypoperfusion
			- Hypotension usually accompanied by compensatory reflex sinus tachycardia
