 If considering that the patient is in shock see shock notes: [Shock](01%20Disciplines/Clinical/Emergencies/Shock.md)
- Thin young females often have a SBP of 80-100 mmHg
# Phone Call/Presentation Questions
- Normal blood pressure? and other observations (notably HR and RR)
- Reason for patient's admission?
- Is the patient symptomatic?
# Common Causes *(Corridor thoughts)*
- Dehydration
- Physiological
- Iatrogenic
- Shock
	- Distributive
	- Cardiogenic
	- Hypovolemic
	- Obstructive
# Assessment
## Bedside and Vitals
- Evaluate the patient from the bedside: do they actually look sick or critical
	- The patient may be pale, agitated and sweaty
- A to E assessment
	- **A**irway clear? Consider intubation and roll patient into the left lateral decubitus position to avoid aspiration; remove loose-fitting dentures
	- **B**reathing: Tachypnoea is common and may indicate lactic acidosis secondary to tissue hypoperfusion, acute LVF or underlying PE, pneumothorax or cardiac tamponade
	- **C**ardiovascular: Measure supine blood pressure in *both* arms
		- Automated NIBP is notriously inaccurate; retake blood pressure manually
		- *Pulse Pressure?*
			- Narrow pulse pressure means low LV stroke volume and shock
			- Wide pulse pressure means [Anaphylaxis](01%20Disciplines/Immunology/Emergencies/Anaphylaxis.md) or [Septicaemia](01%20Disciplines/Infectious%20Disease/Conditions/Septicaemia.md) (i.e. warm shock)
		- *Heart Rate?*
			- Low volume or impalpable peripheral pulses indicates hypoperfusion
			- Hypotension usually accompanied by compensatory reflex sinus tachycardia
	- **D**isability:
		- Is the patient orientated?
		- GCS?
		- Pupils?
		- BSL?
	- **E**nvironment
		- Febrile?
		- Abdomen?
- History
	- Reason for admission
	- HxPC:
		- Chest pain, SOB
		- Pre-syncope
		- Thirsty?
		- When last void?
	- PMHx
- Examination
	- Peripheral CRT, skin turgor
	- Pallor of the palmar creases
	- JVP
	- Heart sounds
	- Calves
- Investigations
	- Note other charts:
		- Fluid charts
		- Medication charts: (e.g. antihypertensives)
	- Bloods
	- Imaging
