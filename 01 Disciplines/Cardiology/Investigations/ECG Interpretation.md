> [!NOTE] Assessing a Rhythm Strip in an Unstable/Critical Patient
> 1. Is there any electrical activity?
> 2. What is the ventricular QRS rate?
> 3. Is the QRS rhythm regular or irregular?
> 4. Is the QRS complex width normal ('narrow') or broad?
> 5. Is atrial activity present?
> 6. Is atrial activity related to ventricular activity and, if so, how?

# Procedure
- 3-electrode system (gives leads I, II and III)
	- ![[Pasted image 20250125180940.png]]
- 5-electrode system (gives leads I, II and III and a single unipolar lead depending on the position of the brown lead V1-6)
	- ![[Pasted image 20250125181011.png]]
# Basics
## Rate, Rhythm, Axis
- Rate
	- Multiply the number of QRS complexes in the 10 second strip by 6 or do 300 divded by the R-R interval in number of large squares
		- 1 square = 300
		- 2 square = 150
		- 3 square = 100
		- 4 square = 75
		- 5 square = 60
		- ![[Pasted image 20250125173546.png]]
- Rhythm
	- If in doubt, use a piece of paper to mark out at least 3 consecutive R waves and check the rate is the same further along the rhythm strip
	- Regular rhythm with abnormal P wave preceding each QRS complex => atrial rhythm
	- Irregular rhythm with P waves => multifocal atrial rhythm
	- Regular narrow-complex rhythm with no (or retrograde) P waves => SVT
	- Regular rhythm with visible flutter waves => atrial flutter
	- Irregular rhythm with no P waves => atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter with variable AV conduction block
- Axis
	- Always compare to the TP line
## P Wave
- P wave configurations in lead II:![[Pasted image 20250125174339.png]]
	- P mitrale => left atrial enlargement
		- ![[Pasted image 20250125174805.png]]
	- P pulmonale => right atrial enlargement
		- ![[Pasted image 20250125174756.png]]
	- ![[Pasted image 20250125174729.png]]
## PR Interval
- Start of P wave to the start of the QRS complex
- Normal duration is 120-200 msec (3-5 small squares)
- First-degree AV block if >200 msec
- Accessory AV pathway/pre-excitation if <120 msec
## Q Waves
- Pathological if any of: 
	- More than 33% of total QRS complex
	- More than 2mm deep
	- More than 40 msec (one small square) width
	- Present in leads V1-3
- Small Q waves can be normal in leads III and V1 as well as I, aVL and V5-6
## QRS Complex
- Duration
	- Normal duration <120 msec
	- Widened QRS suggests some abnormal ventricular conduction (e.g. bundle branch block, ventricular origin, accessory pathway etc.)
	- A wide QRS complex causes secondary ST segment and T wave changes making it sometimes difficult to interpret
- Height
	- Low voltage overall may be caused by body habitus, lung hyperinflation (e.g. COPD), hypothermia, hypothyroidism, pericardial effusion, chronic cardiac ischaemia
## R Wave Progression
- QRS complexes are predominantly negative in V1 and become more positive across to V6, being equipotent at V3 or V4
## ST Segments
- Always assess for:
	- Elevation
	- Depression
	- Shape (concave up, concave down, horizontal etc)
		- Concave up shape is less concerning for ischaemia
## T Waves
- Assess for:
	- Orientation
	- Height
- Normal to have inverted T waves in aVR and V1 and occasionally in V2 and inferior leads
## QT Interval
- Measured from the start of the QTS complex until the end of the T wave
$$
QTc=\frac{QT}{\sqrt{RR\;\rm{interval}\;(seconds)}}
$$
- Prolonged if:
	- QTc >440 msec in men
	- QTC >460 msec in women
- A QTc >500 msec is associated with an increased risk of Torsades de Pointes VT

> [!NOTE] Rule of thumb for QT Intervals
> The QT interval should be less than half of the proceeding R-R interval

## Other Waves
- Delta wave (slurred initial upslope on QRS complex) => ventricular pre-excitation in WPW syndrome
- J (Osborne wave) notch at junction of QRS and ST segment => hypothermia, hypercalcaemia, vasospastic angina, SAH
- U wave (occurs after T wave) => hypokalaemia, bradycardia
# Myocardial Ischaemia and Infarction

> [!TIP] What to do if you are unsure about ischaemic changes in an ECG (provided the patient is stable)
> - Repeat the ECG in 20 minutes
> - Call for help

- ECG changes in ischaemia in order:
	1. Hyperacute T waves
	2. ST-segment elevation/depression
	3. Q waves (although not always)
	4. T wave inversion
	- ![[Pasted image 20250125181257.png]]
- Posterior STEMI features on a standard ECG:
	- Reciprocal changes in anterior leads (V1-3) such as:
		- ST elevation in V1-3
		- Tall, braod (30msec) R waves (uspide down Q waves)
		- Upright T waves
		- Dominant R waves in V2
	- Only 0.5mm of ST elevation in V7, 8 or 9 is required for a diagnosis of posterior STEMI

> [!NOTE] Posterior OMI
> - ST depression maximal in leads V1-4 without progression to V5-6 is highly concerning for a posterior OMI and can be considered to be posterior MI even in the absence of ST elevation in V7-9
> 	- This is because of poor conduction through the aerated lung
> 
> ![[posterior omi v1-3.png]]

- Inferior MI involving the right ventricle ECG features:
	- ST elevation in lead III > lead II
	- ST elevation in V1 > V2
	- ST elevation in V1
	- Consider RV infarct in all cases of inferior MI
	- Proceed with a right sided ECG or use V4RT
	- Be careful of GTN as it can cause hypotension
- De Winter T waves
	- ECG features
		- Tall, prominent, symmetrical T waves in precordial leads
		- Upsloping ST segment depression >1mm at the J point in the precordial leads (no ST elevation int he precordial leads)
		- Reciprocal ST segmeent elevation in aVR
	- Typical STEMI morphology may precede or follow the De Winter pattern
	- Treat as a STEMi equivalent

- Wellen's snydrome
	- ECG features: deeply inverted or biphasic T waves in V2-3

	- Highly specific for critical stenosis of the proximal LAD and often do poorly with medical therapy
	- However do not mix with the right ventricular strain pattern:

- ST and T wave changes in LBBB/paced rhythms

- Left main coronary artery occlusion
	- ECG features (although note that these findings aren't necessarily specific)
		- Widespread ST depression in mostly leads I, II and V4-6
		- ST elevation in aVR â‰¥1mm
		- ST elevation in aVR â‰¥ V1
	- ![[UQERHI4Q2hbqIaOcCNMJYYS7CHr6V8rEK2wuqhxRtZmYP9Az0xMn2XAcEkOxN4mkL-ik_3Lh6SSIa-9_7o3qBH7Tm6CBmzd0_c9oIOv_3C9HoVRSjrfscPn_AkdUBeva.png]]
- Other ECG patterns:
	- ST depression in 2 or more precordial leads may indicate transmural posterior injury
	- Hyperacute T-wave changes may be observed in the early phase of STEMI
	- New RBBB and LAFB is highly associated with proximal LAD occlusion
# Conduction Disease

## Sinus Node Dysfunction
### Sinus Arrhythmia
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6yTQm2h8dc
![[Pasted image 20250105125426.png]]
![[Pasted image 20250105125554.png]]
- Note that all the P waves as the same morphology indicating that they likely originate from the same area/place
### SA Nodal Exit Block
- Depolorisation of the SA node itself does not produce any discernable ECG features
![[Pasted image 20250105130252.png]]
![[Pasted image 20250105130341.png]]
 - Difficult to diagnose SA nodal exit block on ECG, generally some kind of EP study is needed
### Sinus Pause
![[Pasted image 20250105130434.png]]
### Sinus Arrest
- Sinus arrest = long sinus pause
	- Will result in asystole if no escape rhythm present
![[Pasted image 20250105130531.png]]
### Sick Sinus Syndrome
![[Sinus Node Dysfunction Venn Diagram.excalidraw.png]]
%%[[Sinus Node Dysfunction Venn Diagram.excalidraw.md|ðŸ–‹ Edit in Excalidraw]]%%
- Sick sinus syndrome = sinus node dysfunction + secondary symptoms (e.g. lightheadedness, syncope, heart failure symptoms)
- Tachycardia-bradycardia syndrome = sick sinus syndrome + atrial tachyarrhythmia (e.g. atrial flutter or atrial fibrillation)
