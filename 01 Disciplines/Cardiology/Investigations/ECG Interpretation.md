- Note that all the P waves as the same morphology indicating that they likely originate from the same area/place
## SA Nodal Exit Block
- Depolorisation of the SA node itself does not produce any discernable ECG features

 - Difficult to diagnose SA nodal exit block on ECG, generally some kind of EP study is needed
## Sinus Pause

## Sinus Arrest
- Sinus arrest = long sinus pause
	- Will result in asystole if no escape rhythm present

## Sick Sinus Syndrome

%%[[Sinus Node Dysfunction Venn Diagram.excalidraw|ðŸ–‹ Edit in Excalidraw]]%%
- Sick sinus syndrome = sinus node dysfunction + secondary symptoms (e.g. lightheadedness, syncope, heart failure symptoms)
- Tachycardia-bradycardia syndrome = sick sinus syndrome + atrial tachyarrhythmia (e.g. atrial flutter or atrial fibrillation)
