# Aetiology
- Monomicrobial
	- streptococci (especially _Streptococcus pyogenes_)
	- _Clostridium perfringens_ and other _Clostridium_ species ⇒ causes gas gangrene
	- _Staphylococcus aureus_
	- _Vibrio vulnificus_ and other _Vibrio_ species
	- _Aeromonas hydrophila_
- Polymicrobial
	- Synergistic gangrene mixed aerob-anaerobe (eg _Escherichia coli_, _Bacteroides fragilis_, streptococci and staphylococci)
	- Fournier gangrene – synergistic gangrene of the genitalia, usually following genital trauma (eg postpartum) or spread from a perianal, retroperitoneal or urinary tract infection; unfortunately has a high death rate ranging from 15% to 50%
	- Necrotising infection of the head and neck – generally polymicrobial and can occur in the setting of odontogenic infection or following oropharyngeal surgery or trauma
# Definitions
- Type 1: Polymyocrobial
	- Causes include:  _Staphylococcus aureus_, Haemophilus, Vibrio and several other aerobic and anaerobic strains (_Escherichia coli_, _Bacteroides fragilis_)
	- Usually seen in older people or in patients affected by diabetes mellitus or other conditions
- Type 2: Haemolytic group A streptococcus and/or staphylococci including MRSA
	- Sensationalised in the media as flesh-eating disease
	- Affects all age groups and healthy people are also prone to infection (almost half of cases)
- Type 3: Gas gangrene
	- Usually follows significant injury or surgery and results in gas under the skin
	- People who inject “black tar” heroin subcutaneously can also be infected with clostridia
# Risk Factors
- Streptococcal necrotising fasciitis can occur in young and previously health individuals
- Precipitating factors:
	- An opening in the skin that allows bacteria to enter the body such as minor injury (e.g. small cut, graze, pinprick, injection) or large wound (eg, laparoscopy, sclerotherapy, endoscopic gastrostomy, thoracostomy, Caesarean section, hysterectomy); but often no point of entry can be found
	- Cervicofacial necrotising fasciitis can follow mandibular fracture or dental infection
	- Direct contact with a person who is carrying the bacteria or the bacteria is already present elsewhere on the person
	- In children, type II necrotising fasciitis may complicate chickenpox
- Risk factors:
	- NSAIDs
	- Advanced age
	- Diabetes mellitus
	- Immune suppression
	- Obesity
	- Drug abuse
	- Severe chronic
	- illness
	- Malignancy
# Clinical Features
- Consider necrotising infection in patients who are critically ill with a skin and soft tissue infection
- Diagnosis of necrotising skin and soft tissue infections is difficult but clinical features include:
	- Constant severe pain, even if skin inflammation is initially limited
	- Bullae
	- Skin necrosis or bruising
	- Hard (‘wooden’) subcutaneous tissue that is painful on palpation
	- Oedema beyond the margin of erythema
	- Cutaneous anaesthesia
	- Gas in the soft tissues (detected by palpation with skin or soft tissue crepitus or imaging)
	- Systemic features, including fever, leucocytosis, elevated C-reactive protein (CRP), delirium or acute kidney impairment
	- Rapidly spreading infection
- Penetrating and crush injuries often lead to necrotising skin and soft tissue infections
- Life-threatening _S. pyogenes_ necrotising fasciitis can occur spontaneously or follow varicella infection (chickenpox)
	- _S. pyogenes_ necrotising fasciitis typically involves the limb and is associated with nonpenetrating trauma or any injury that breaks the skin
- Clostridal myonecrosis (gas gangene) occurs after a traumatic wound with associated vascular compromise
- [[Diabetes]] is also a risk factor
# Management
- Mainstay of management is surgical removal of devitalised tissue and urgent antibiotic therapy
- Empirical therapy for necrotising skin and soft tissue infection **not associated with water exposure** use:
	- Meropenem IV, vancomycin IV and clindamycin IV
		- Meropenem can be replaced with tazocin if there is low suspicion of multidrug-resistant gram negative infection or meropenem not immediately available
- Empirical  therapy for necrotising skin and soft tissue infection **associated with water exposure** use:
	- Meropenem IV, vancomycin IV, ciprofloxacin IV and clindamycin IV
- Where _S. pyogenes_ is suspected, intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) as a single dose no later than 72 hours after symptom onset (can be given as multiple doses if not possible to give as single dose)
- Modify therapy based on Gram stain, culture and susceptibility:
	- _S. pyogenes_ ⇒ benzylpenicillin/cefazolin IV, clindamycin IV and IVIG ⇒ step down to oral amoxicillin
	- _Clostridium_ species ⇒ benzylpenicillin/metronidazole IV and clindamycin
	- MRSA ⇒ vancomycin and clindamycin
- Switch to oral antibiotic therapy when further debridement is no longer necessary, there has been clinical improvement, and the patient has been afebrile for 48 to 72 hours
