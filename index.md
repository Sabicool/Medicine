# How I Studied in Medical School
This is a non-exhaustive guide to studying in medical school. I do plan on making a more complete guide one day but until then here's some words of wisdom.

I rarely made comprehensive notes. I mainly studied by doing pre-made flashcard decks and a bunch of questions. Closer to exams for my OSCE exams in particular, I would try to learn by approaches to presenting complaints.

> [!TIP] 
> I used to take notes using notion during medical school. I found it to be fairly reliable and meant that I did not need to bring a laptop to placement to take notes. I could simply just login to notion and take notes or even review my notes from any computer I had access to on placement. You can find my notes here [https://mango-cellar-b90.notion.site/](https://mango-cellar-b90.notion.site/ "my medicine notes on notion"). Another alternative is Remnote, which provides a more unified experience with flashcard support but it can be a bit buggy at times. Personally I have been moving towards trying to use more FOSS (hence this website).

## Useful Resources
- Your university resources (my university resources have been kept private)
- State based/hospital based guidelines (e.g. RCH, ACI, PCH, KEMH guidelines) 
- National guidelines (e.g. RACGP Red Book, RANZCOG guidelines)
- Other national resources (e.g. eTG, AMH Online)
- Other useful Australian resources: LITFL
- Other useful resources: Teach Me Series (e.g. Teach me surgery, Teach me Obgyn), Amboss
# How I made these notes
- I use a mixture of Emacs and Obsidian to take these notes[^1]. These notes are for the most part formatted in markdown and hopefully made to be quite presentable and accurate.

I do want to add some improvements to the notes:

- [x] Make a functional website; something like quartz might work well
- [x] Add a date last updated to all the notes
- [x] Implement way to add cards from Obsidian to Anki[^2]
    - Anything surrounded by curly braces is likely a card that has been incorporated into the Malleus anki deck *(I can't demonstrate here, otherwise it'll create a card)*
# Footnotes

[^1]: Both are great applications for note taking but unfortunately there might be some barrier to using either application because of the initial learning to use either program. If that is the case for you, I'd recommend something like notion or remnote to take notes on
[^2]: I should generally be adding these cards to the Malleus Clinical Medicine Anki project
