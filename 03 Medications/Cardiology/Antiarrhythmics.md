# Amiodarone
- Contraindicated in second‑ or third-degree heart block (without pacemaker), symptomatic bradycardia (without pacemaker) or sick sinus syndrome (without pacemaker).
- Check that QT interval is <500 milliseconds before use as amiodarone may increase risk of arrhythmia by prolonging the QT interval. Avoid use if risk factors for [prolonged QT interval](https://amhonline.amh.net.au.acs.hcn.com.au/chapters/cardiovascular-drugs/drugs-arrhythmias/arrhythmias#arrhythmias-0201) cannot be corrected
