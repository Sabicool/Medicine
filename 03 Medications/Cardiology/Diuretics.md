# Thiazide Diuretics
- Mechanism of action
	- Inhibit sodium reabsorption at the beginning of the DCT by blocking thiazide sensitive $\ce{Na+}-\ce{Cl-}$ symporter
	- Increased sodium delivery to the DCT promotes excretion of potassium
	- When used in lower doses for hypertension, thiazides lower BP mostly by a vasodilator effect
- Indications
	- Hypertension
	- Oedema associated with heart failure or hepatic cirrhosis
	- Nephrogenic diabetes insipidus
- Adverse effects
	- Dehydration and postural hypotension
	- Hypokalaemia
	- Hyponatraemia
		- May precipitate heart failure with significant oedema at higher doses in conjunction with salt-restricted diet and/or potassium-sparing diuretics
	- Hypercalcaemia
		- Also causes hypocalciuria which decreases incidence of stones
	- Gout
		- Secondary to diuretic-induced hyperuricaemia typically at higher doses
		- Measure serum urate levels every 2-5 weeks and adjust dose of urate-lowering drugs if necessary
	- Impaired glucose tolerance
	- Pregnancy
