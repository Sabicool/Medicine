# 5-$\ce{HT3}$ Receptor Antagonists
- Indication: general use with particular use in acute gastroenteritis
- Ondansetron 4-8mg IV/PO 8-12 hourly
# Dopamine Antagonists
- EPSE (acute dystonic reactions) are more common in the elderly and people <20 years
- EPSE is rarer with domperidone
- Domperidone and metoclopramide have prokinetic activity which may be useful in gastroparesis
- Metoclopramide 10mg IV/IM/PO 8-hourly
	- Particular use in migraine or acute gastroenteritis
	- Avoid use in patients younger than 20 years and older persons—acute dystonic reactions are more common in young adults and older persons
	- Can cause extrapyramidal adverse effects—avoid in Parkinson disease
	- Can cause irreversible tardive dyskinesia
	- Do not use for longer than 5 days
	- Avoid if stimulation of the gastrointestinal tract is dangerous (eg gastrointestinal obstruction or perforation) 
- Prochlorperazine 20mg PO first dose then 10mg PO 2 hours later then 5-10mg PO 8-hourly
	- General use, particularly for nausea and vomiting associated with migraine, motion sickness or acute gastroenteritis
	- Can cause sedation, prolongation of the QT interval and extrapyramidal adverse effects, including tardive dyskinesia and akathisia; avoid in Parkinson disease
	- Can have anticholinergic effects
- Droperidol is often used for prevent [[Post-Operative Nausea and Vomiting|PONV]] 0.25-0.625 mg IM as a single dose
	- Mostly limited use with particular use for opioid induced nausea and vomiting and anxious or agitated patients
	- Has a long duration of action and counteracts adverse opioid effects
	- Can cause sedation and EPS; avoid in Parkinsons
# Sedating Antihistamines
- Promethazine 25mg orally every 4-6 hours (max 100 mg in 24 hours)
	- General use, with particular use in motion sickness
	- Can cause sedation, lower the seizure threshold and have anticholinergic effects
	- Can cause extrapyramidal adverse effects, including tardive dyskinesia; avoid in Parkinson disease
- Cyclizine for motion sickness
# Anticholinergics
- Hyoscine hydrobromide can be used prevent motion sickness
# Substance P Antagonists
- Aprepitant, fosaprepitant, fosnetupitant and netupitant are used with a 5HT3 antagonist and dexamethasone to prevent nausea and vomiting with highly or moderately emetogenic chemotherapy
# Corticosteroids
- Dexamethasone is used to prevent 
	- Limited use with [[Post-Operative Nausea and Vomiting|PONV]] and as adjunctive treatment in chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting or with bowel obstruction or raised intracranial pressure
	- May cause mood or sleep disturbance; other adverse effects are unlikely with a single dose
	- Use with caution in sepsis, haematological malignancy and diabetes
