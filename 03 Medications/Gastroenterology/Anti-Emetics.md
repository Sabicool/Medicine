	- Acute gastroenteritis
	- Pancreatitis
	- Mesenteric ischemia
	- Appendicitis, cholecystitis
	- Constipation
- Central Nervous System
- Ear and labyrinthine disorders (often associated with vertigo)
	- Vestibular neuronitis
	- Meniere's disease
	- Otitis media
- Intracranial pressure elevation
- Migraine

	- Anesthetic agents
	- Antibiotics
		- Erythromycin

    - Antihypertensives (beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers) 
    - Digoxin 
    - Diuretics 
- Endocrine
    - Oral contraception

- Ensure adequate hydration
# Dopamine Antagonists
- EPSE (acute dystonic reactions) are more common in the elderly and people <20 years
- EPSE is rarer with domperidone
- Domperidone and metoclopramide have prokinetic activity which may be useful in gastroparesis
- Droperidol is often used for prevent [[Post-Operative Nausea and Vomiting|PONV]]
	- Has a long duration of action and counteracts adverse opioid effects
# Sedating Antihistamines
- Promethazine prevents motion sickness and for N&V associated with vestibular disorders
- Cyclizine for motion sickness
# Anticholinergics
- Hyoscine hydrobromide can be used prevent motion sickness
# Ondansetron antagonists
- Used to prevent or treat nausea and vomiting following cancer chemotherapy, radiotherapy or surgery
# Substance P Antagonists
- Aprepitant, fosaprepitant, fosnetupitant and netupitant are used with a 5HT3 antagonist and dexamethasone to prevent nausea and vomiting with highly or moderately emetogenic chemotherapy
# Corticosteroids
- Dexamethasone is used to prevent PONV and as adjunctive treatment in chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting
