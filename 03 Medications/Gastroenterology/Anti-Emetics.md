# Dopamine Antagonists
- EPSE (acute dystonic reactions) are more common in the elderly and people <20 years
- EPSE is rarer with domperidone
- Domperidone and metoclopramide have prokinetic activity which may be useful in gastroparesis
- Droperidol is often used for prevent [[Post-Operative Nausea and Vomiting|PONV]]
	- Has a long duration of action and counteracts adverse opioid effects
# Sedating Antihistamines
- Promethazine prevents motion sickness and for N&V associated with vestibular disorders
- Cyclizine for motion sickness
# Anticholinergics
- Hyoscine hydrobromide can be used prevent motion sickness
# Ondansetron antagonists
- Used to prevent or treat nausea and vomiting following cancer chemotherapy, radiotherapy or surgery
# Substance P Antagonists
- Aprepitant, fosaprepitant, fosnetupitant and netupitant are used with a 5HT3 antagonist and dexamethasone to prevent nausea and vomiting with highly or moderately emetogenic chemotherapy
# Corticosteroids
- Dexamethasone is used to prevent PONV and as adjunctive treatment in chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting
