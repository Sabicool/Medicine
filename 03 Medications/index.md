This is a list of common and important medications organised broadly by discipline. Again see the disclaimer at the bottom. This is meant to just be a quick reference. All doses are for adult patients with normal renal and hepatic function, unless otherwise stated.

The ones I seem to most frequently reference are:
- [[Analgesics]]
- [[Antibacterials]]
- [[Anti-emetics]]
- [[Nutritional/Electrolyte Supplements]]
- [[Fluids]]
- [[Aperients and Laxatives]]
- [[Bronchodilators]]
- [[Anti-Ulcer Drugs#Proton Pump Inhibitors|PPIs]]

Notes:
- beta blockers
	- Non selective 
However, lungs contain mainly ẞ2 receptor sites.
Non-selective ẞ-blockers (e.g. propranolol) will reduce BP, but will also cause unwanted adverse effects such as bronchoconstriction (since the ẞ2-agonist effect is bronchodilation).
Therefore, non-selective B-blockers cannot be used in patients with asthma. 
ẞ1 -selective antagonists may be used with caution, provided benefit outweighs risk
