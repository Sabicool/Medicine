Do you use a lot of milk, fancy a milk bath or have a big freezer? Coles lite milk 20 cents for 2 litres. Lots of stock, 10 cents a litre, cheaper than bottled water.

So many bottles all marked for the 21st of October, oh dear. Someone on the team (profanity) up and might get pushed out a window soon.

Also, the deadline is the end of today (20th), not tomorrow, because I don't think it is legal for them to sell it beyond the end of today.

I've tried to buy some bottles that were expiring on the same day and depending on the staff member, some will wretch it out of your hand to dispose of it, some will let you take it for free as long as you promise not to sue them if you get sick.

It's illegal to sell after the use by date, selling on the use by date is ok

Hard to sue them when you've stolen the milk.

   Using that logic, if there's something in your house that you don't need and you've invited me to take it from you for free, is that stealing? Are you going to immediately call the police the moment I step out the door?  
         * > if there's something in your house that you don't need and you've invited me to take it from you for free, is that stealing?  
         No it's not stealing because it's something I own and can choose to do what I want with it.  
         A staff member at Coles cannot give you permission to take something for free because they don't have the authority to do so and it isn't their inventory. All they can do is look the other way and not report the theft.

Lol umm yeah a pinky promise isn't going to hold up in court. There's nothing for the staff member to gain, and their job to lose so I would understand why they wouldn't be super keen on the idea.  
It scans as "unable to be sold".
