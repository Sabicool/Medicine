# Definition
- Dumping syndrome: rapid gastric emptying as a result of defective gastric reservoir function, impaired pyrloci emptying mechanism or anomalous postsurgery gastric motor function
# Early Dumping
- Dysfunctional or bypassed pyloric sphincter → rapid emptying of undiluted hyperosmolar chyme into the small intestine → fluid shift to the intestinal lumen → small bowel distention → vagal stimulation → ↑ increased intestinal motility
## Clinical Features
- Occurs within 15-30 minutes after meal ingestion
- Include nausea, vomiting diarrhoea and cramps
- Vasomotor symptoms such as sweating, flushing and palpitations
## Management
- Dietary modifications: small meals that include combination of complex carbohydrates and foods rich in protein and fat
- 30-60 min of rest in the supine position after meals
- Beta blockers may be helpful to ease tachycardia arising from hypovolemia
# Late Dumping
- Dysfunctional pyloric sphincter → rapid emptying of glucose-containing chyme into the small intestine → quick reabsorption of hlucose → hyperglycaemia → ↑ insulin → hypoglycaemia and release of catecholamines
## Clinical Features
- Occurs hours after meal ingestion
- Include signs of hypogylcaemia (e.g. hunger, tremor and lightheadedness)
- GI discomfort
## Mangement
- Dietary modifications
- Second-line: ocreotide
- Third-line: surgery
