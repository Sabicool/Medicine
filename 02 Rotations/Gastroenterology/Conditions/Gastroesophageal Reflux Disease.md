# Definition
More of a spectrum from gastro-oesophageal reflux → gastro-oesophageal reflux disease.
- GORD is considerd to be present if:
	- symptoms occur ≥2 times per week
	- impact quality of life significantly
	- complications are present (oesophageal ulceration and sequelae or extra-oesophageal symptoms)
# Clinical Features
Severity of symptoms is not a reliable indicator of the severity of disease.
- Is endoscopy useful for diagnosis of gord?
	- approximately two-thirds of all people with reflux symptoms have no evidence of macroscopic inflammation on upper gastrointestinal endoscopy
	- endoscopy is not routinely recommended for patients who have typical symptoms of gastro-oesophageal reflux (heartburn or regurgitation) that respond to treatment. endoscopic findings must be interpreted in the context of any acid suppression therapy the patient is taking.
