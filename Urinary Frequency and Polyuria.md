# Phone Call/Presentation Questions
- What is the main problem the patient complains of?
	- Polyuria = urine output >3L/day on review of the fluid balance chart
	- Frequency of urination = frequent passage of urine, whether larger or small volume
- Vital signs
- Is the patient catheterised
- What was the reason for admission
## Instructions Over the Phone
- In a patient with mental state changes or who is sick:
	- Request for insertion of an IDC if one is not already in place
	- Ask for an IV trolley for the patientâ€™s bedside to await your arrival
	- Check fingerprick BGL
	- Collect and send serum for FBC, UEC and LFTs
	- Collect a urine sample, perform bedside urinalysis and prepare sample to send for MCS and urinary electrolyte analysis
	- Commence volume replacement with initial bolus of 10-20mL/kg normal saline if the patient has signs of volume depletion
## Prioritisation
- Immediate review if there are significant changes in vital signs, mental status or features of dehydration
- Otherwise a patient with polyuria, frequency or inctoninence need not to be seen urgently if the vital signs are stable
# Common Cause *(Corridor Thoughts)*
- Polyuria
	- Diabetes mellitus (osmotic diuresis)
	- Diabetes insipidus
		- Either central DI or nephrogenic DI
		- DI is most commonly caused by head trauma, cerebral oedema, pituitary tumours or prescribed medication
	- Drugs
		- Diuretics, mannitol
		- Lithium toxicity, amphotericin B, demeclocycline
	- Renal disease
		- Diuretic phase of acute tubular necrosis
		- Post-obstructive diuresis
		- Salt-losing nephritis
		- Polycystic kidney disease (causes nephrogenic DI)
		- Hypercalcaemia (nephrogenic DI)
		- Hypokalaemia (nephrogenic DI)
		- Physiological diuresis following large volumes of PO or IV fluids during the resolution phase of major illness or during recovery from major surgery
		- Primary psychogenic polydipsia
- Increased frequency
	- Urinary tract infection
	- Partial bladder outlet obstruction
	- Bladder irritation
	- Large fluid intake
	- Psychological
- Incontinence
	- Urge incontinence
	- Stress incontinence
		- Usually in multiparous women
		- In men it occurs after prostate surgery
	- Overflow incontinence
		- Bladder obstructino such as BPH, urethral stricture, spinal cord disease, autonomic neuropathy, faecal impaction[^1]
	- Iatrogenic factors
		- Diuretics, sedatives, anticholinergics drugs, alpha-blockers, calcium channel blockers, ACE inhibitors
	- Environmental factors
		- Inaccessible call bell, poor mobility, obstacles to the bathroom
