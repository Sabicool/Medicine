# How I Studied in Medical School
This is a non-exhaustive guide to studying in medical school.

I rarely made comprehensive notes. I mainly studied by doing pre-made flashcard decks and a bunch of questions. Closer to exams for my OSCE exams in particular, I would try to learn by approaches to presenting complaints.

> [!TIP] 
> I used to take notes using notion during medical school. I found it to be fairly reliable and meant that I did not need to bring a laptop to placement to take notes. I could simply just login to notion and take notes or even review my notes from any computer I had access to on placement. You can find my notes here [https://mango-cellar-b90.notion.site/](https://mango-cellar-b90.notion.site/ "my medicine notes on notion")

# How I made these notes
- I use a mixture of Emacs and Obsidian to take these notes[^1]. These notes are for the most part formatted in markdown and hopefully made to be quite presentable and accurate.

I do want to add some improvements to the notes:

- [ ] Make a functional website; something like quartz might work well
- [ ] Add a date last updated to all the notes
- [ ] Implement way to add cards from Obsidian to Anki[^2]
# Footnotes

[^1]: Both are great applications for note taking but unfortunately there might be some barrier to using it because of the initial learning to use the program. If that is the case for you, I'd recommend something like notion or remnote to take notes on
[^2]: I should generally be adding these cards to the Malleus Clinical Medicine Anki project
