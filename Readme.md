# How I Studied in Medical School
This is a non-exhaustive guide to studying in medical school.

I rarely made comprehensive notes. I mainly studied by doing pre-made flashcard decks and a bunch of questions. Closer to exams for my OSCE exams in particular, I would try to learn by approaches to presenting complaints.
