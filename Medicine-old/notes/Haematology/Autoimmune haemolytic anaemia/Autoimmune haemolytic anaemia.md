# Cold AIHA
- 🍒Cold autoimmune haemolytic anaemia is mediated by `IgM` autoantibodies
- 🍒Cold autoimmune haemolytic anaemia can occur secondary to what other diseases?
    
    - [[Mycoplasma pneumoniae]] or [[Epstein-Barr virus]] infection
    - Malignancy (e.g. [[non-Hodgkin lymphoma]], [[Chronic lymphocytic leukemia]]

    Cold weather is MMMMiserable: Cold (IgM) AIHA is seen in Malignancy (CLL), Mycoplasma pneumonia, and Mononucleosis
    
![[Untitled 62.png|Untitled 62.png]]
Agglutination of RBCs; spherocytes may be seen
- 🍒What is the acute management of cold autoimmune haemolytic anaemia?
    
    RBC transfusion as needed
    
    Plasmapheresis and trial of glucocorticoids (e.g. [[Prednisolone]])
    
- 🍒What is the long term management of cold autoimmune haemolytic anaemia?
    
    Systemic immunomodulators: 1st line: [[Rituximab]] (ant-CD20 antibody)
    
- 🍒Is splenectomy recommended for cold autoimmune haemolytic anaemia?
    
    No. It is not effective as most extravascular haemolysis occurs in the liver.
    
# Warm AIHA
- 🍒Warm autoimmune haemolytic anaemia is mediated by `IgG` autoantibodies
    
    Warm weather is Great”: Warm AIHA is IgG mediated
    
- 🍒What is the acute management of warm autoimmune haemolytic anaemia?
    
    RBC transfusion as needed
    
    Early treatment with high-dose glucocorticoids (e.g. methylprednisolone)
    
    Rescue therapy with IVIG or plasma exchange
    
- 🍒What is the long term management for warm autoimmune haemolytic anaemia?
    
    1st line: High dose glucocorticoids
    
    2nd line: [[Rituximab]]
    
    3rd line: Splenectomy
    
- 🍒Is splenectomy recommended for warm autoimmune haemolytic anaemia?
    
    Potentially. Third line management to glucocorticoids and rituxmiab
