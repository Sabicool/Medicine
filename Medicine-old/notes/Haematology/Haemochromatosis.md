Hereditary haemochromatosis is treated by removing iron via venesection to normalise total body iron stores. Usually this is efficiently done by venesection of 500 mL of blood every 1 to 2 weeks until serum ferritin concentration is between 50 and 100 micrograms/L; this may take many months. Less frequent venesection may be appropriate for some patients, depending on the clinical situation and degree of iron overload.
Maintenance venesection is required about three times a year, to keep the serum ferritin concentration below 100 micrograms/L.
