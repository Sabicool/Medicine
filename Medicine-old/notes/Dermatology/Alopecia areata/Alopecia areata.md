Alopecia areata is a complex polygenic autoimmune disorder. Unknown environmental triggers signal an auto-inflammatory immune response that causes anagen phase hairs in the affected area to convert to telogen phase. Hair prematurely stops growing and sheds rapidly, causing patches of alopecia.
- Aetiology
    - Mostly unknown
    - There may be a specific trigger such as a febrile illness or severe emotional stress (for example, the death of a family member)
        - Less severe day-to-day stress is not considered to be a trigger
    - There is a strong family history component
- Clinical features
    
    - Discrete, often circular, areas of hair loss anywhere on the body
    - Patients typically present when hairloss in on the scalp, eyebrows or beard
    
    - üçíA type of alopecia areata involving the entire scalp is called `alopecia totalis`
    - üçíA type of alopecia areata involving the entire scalp and whole body is called `alopecia universalis`
    - üçíAlopecia areata is characterised by unpredictable `remission and relapse::timing`
        
        A patch may:
        
        - Regrow spontaneously
        - Stay the same for many months
        - Enlarge and coalesce with other patches
    - üçíPeak incidence of alopecia areata is `20-30s`
        
        Most patients experience onset before 40
        
    - üçíCharacteristic `exclamation point` hairs may be observed in alopecia areata, particularly at the periphery of bald patches

- Prognosis
    
    - Poor prognostic indicators:
        - onset in childhood
        - extensive disease at initial presentation
        - ophiasis pattern (ie band-like alopecia involving the posterior scalp margin)
        - family history of alopecia areata or a predisposition to autoimmune conditions
        - history of atopy
        - nail changes (eg pits, roughening)
    
    - üçíIn alopecia areata, patients with a single patch of hair loss have a `80% chance` of spontaneous complete regrowth within 12 months
        
        Other sources:
        
        Approximately a 33% chance of complete regrowth  
        within six months and a 50% chance within one year  
        
- Management
    - üçíWhat is the management of alopecia areata
        
        Limited hair loss of recent onset:
        
        1. Potent topical [[Corticosteroids]] for 3-4 months (betamethasone diproprionate or mometasone furoate)
        2. Intralesional corticosteroid injections every 6-8 weeks
        
        Extensive hair loss or involving eyebrows and eyelashes
        
        - Referral to dermatology
        - Comouflage with wigs, false eyelashes and styling products

        Also consider need for education and counselling as hair loss can be distressing
