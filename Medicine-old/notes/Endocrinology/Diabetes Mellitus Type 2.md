- Pathophysiology
   - Type 2 diabetes is associated with a progressive loss of pancreatic beta-cell insulin secretion on a background of insulin resistance, causing relative insulin deficiency
- Clinical features
    - Asymptomatic initially
    - üçíIs ketosis possible in diabetes mellitus type 2?
        Yes! It may occur in patients with poor oral intake or significant acute concurrent **illness**

- Screening and prevention
    - Screening
        - üçíWhat tool is used to screen for diabetes mellitus type 2 in those with risk factors?
            
            AUDSRISK
            
            - Those at intermediate (score 6-11) or high risk (score ‚â•12) should  
                be tested for prediabetes.  
                
            
            ---
            
            Risk factors for prediabetes include: age, ethnicity, family history of diabetes, history of gestational diabetes mellitus, polycystic ovary syndrome, overweight/obesity, waist circumference, unhealthy diet, sedentary behaviour, poor sleep, smoking, metabolic syndrome and medications that can induce hyperglycaemia
            
        - üçíAbove what score for the AUDSRISK would you consider testing for prediabetes?
            
            ‚â•6 (i.e. intermediate or high risk)
            
        - üçíIn patients with pre-diabetes what is the preferred way and frequency of screening for diabetes?
            
            Annual testing of HbA1c
            
            ---
            
            Pre-diabetic patients are at low risk of hypoglycaemia and therefore selkf-monitoring of blood glucose is not recommended
            
    - Prevention
        - Lifestyle
            - Targeted weight reduction
                - Weight loss of 5-10% halves the risk of developing type 2 diabetes
            - Healthy eating
            - Physical activity (both aerobic and resistance exercise)
                - 150-300 minutes per week of moderate to vigorous intensity aerobic and resisteance exercise
                - Reduction in sedentary behaviour
            - Stress management
            - Improved sleep
            - Smoking cessation
        - Medications
            - No TGA-approved medications but metformin has the strongest evidence
        - Surgery
            - Bariatric surgery (see below)
- Diagnostics

    - üçíDo you need to do multiple tests to confirm the diagnosis of diabetes (any type) in patients who are symptomatic?
        
        No! Diabetes can be diagnosed clinically in a symptomatic patient and confirmed by a single positive result from one test. Genearlly a random plasma or fasting plasma glucose is satisfactory.
        
        ---
        
        ![[Untitled 2 16.png|Untitled 2 16.png]]
        
        The wording for reimbursement states that only asymptomatic patients should be considered for this test. Many of the symptoms in isolation are not specific for diabetes mellitus. For example, there may be many reasons for the development of tiredness or blurred vision as isolated symptoms. The ADS recommends that these patients be considered asymptomatic and are suitable for the test, but only if they fulfil the high-risk requirement
        
    
    > [!important]  
    > The presence of symptoms suggestive of hyperglycaemia with one of the following is confirmatory of a diagnosis of diabetes:a patient presenting with hyperglycaemic crisisa single elevated FBG ‚â•7.0 mmol/Lsingle HbA1c ‚â•6.5%a random blood glucose ‚â•11.1 mmol/L.A second laboratory test is not required to confirm the diagnosis, unless diagnostic uncertainty remains. Clinical signs include:Lethargy, polyuria, polydipsiaFrequent fungal or bacterial infectionsBlurred visionLoss of sensation (i.e. touch, vibration or cold)Poor wound healingWeight loss  
    
    - üçíFor which patient groups is HbA1c recommended for diagnosis of diabetes?
        
        Symptomatic patients at high risk:
        
        - Underlying medical condition or ethnic background with high rates of T2DM
        - AUDSRISK ‚â•12 (especially if >25 years old)

        ![[Untitled 10 4.png|Untitled 10 4.png]]
        
        - üçíIn general practice, the management of diabetes mellitus type 2 should involve the formulation of a `diabetes management plan`
            
            A multidisciplinary team for diabetes can provide the best environment to support the patient and help them to achieve their goals.
            
            The team may include general practitioners, endocrinologists, diabetes educators, social workers, dietitians, pharmacists, podiatrists, Aboriginal health workers, dentists, exercise physiologists and psychologists.
            
            One health professional (eg nurse practitioner, diabetes educator, general practitioner, endocrinologist) should be responsible for coordinating the diabetes management plan with the patient to ensure continuity of care.
            
        - üçíAs a brief overview, a diabetes management plan should include what?
            
            - Short and long term goals including treatment targets
            - A plan for dietary intake
            - A physical activity and exercise plan
            - A medication management plan
            - A sick day management plan
            - Screening and monitoring for complications of diabetes
            - Reducing cardiovascular risk
            
            ---
            
            Other elements:
            
            - Plan for self managment of diabetes
            - Review dates for care plans
    - Lifestyle management
        - Low carbohydrate diet
            - Can assist to achieve glycaemic target but no evidence they help in the log term
            - Low GI foods
            - Reduce sugar intake (superior than substituting for non-nutritive sweeteners)
                - Avoid the sweetener fructose: it promotes triglyceride synthesis in the liver, exacerbates insulin resistance and interferes with satiety mechanisms
            - Can lead to remission in patients (e.g. patients with diabetes for less than 6 years who have followed a medically supervised very low-calorie diet [approximately 800 kcal/day] for 8 weeks)
        - Physical activity and exercise
            
            _From what I‚Äôm reading, it seems that this is more important than the diet_
            
            - Regular physical activity for patients with type 2 diabetes (eg walking briskly for 150 minutes per week, jogging for 90 minutes per week) improves the glycaemic profile and patient wellbeing.
            - Minimise sedentary behavour ‚Üí interrupt sitting every 30 minutes
            - Adjust insulin dose before and after exercise
    - Medications

            - üçíWhat should be done with [[Biguanide (Metformin)]] in patients with T2DM who are acutely sick and why?
                
                Consider withholding temporarily (especially in patients with kidney impairment) and restart when the patient is eating and drinking normally and kidney function is returned to baseline
                
                Dehydration may worsen kidney function reducing metfomrin clearance increasing the risk of lactic acidosis
                
            - üçíWhat should be done with [[SGLT-2 inhibitors (-flozin)]] in patients with T2DM who are acutely sick and why?
                
                Withold and initiate ketone monitoring. Restart when patient is eating and drinking normally, and kidney function has returned to baseline.
                
                Illness, dehydration and low carbohydrate intake increases the risk of [[Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA)]]
                
            - üçíWhat should be done with [[GLP-1 receptor agonists (-glutide)]] in patients with T2DM who are acutely sick and why?
                
                Potentially withhold temporarily if the acute illness causes nausea, vomiting and anorexia as it can exacerbate these symptoms
                
            - üçíWhat should be done with [[Sulfonylureas (glicazide)]] in patients with T2DM who are acutely sick and why?
                
                Continue as tolerated but stop if blood glucose is tending towards lower range to avoid hypoglycaemia
                
            - üçíWhat should be done with [[DPP-4 inhibitors (-gliptin)]] in patients with T2DM whoa re acutely sick and why?
                
                Continue. Unlikely to cause hypoglycaemia
