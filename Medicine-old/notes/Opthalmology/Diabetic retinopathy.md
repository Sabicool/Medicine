- Pathophysiology
    - Degeneration of pericyte (cells that wrap around capillaries)
        - Microaneurysms which rupture → haemorrhage
- Nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy (95%)
    - Clinical features
        
        - 🍒The earliest sign of diabetic retinopathy is `microaneurysms`
        
        - Dot and blot haemorrhages → leakage of fluid
        - Cotton-wool spots
            - Nerve infarctions
            - Occlusion of pre-capillary arterioles
        - Hard exudates/macular oedema
            - Macular swelling with yellow exudates of fatty lipids → blindness in diabetics
        
        - 🍒What are the three features of non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy on fundoscopy?
            
            1. Retinal haemorrhages
            2. Lipid exudates
            3. Cotton wool spots

- Proliferative diabetic retinopathy
    - Clinical features
        - Vessel proliferation
            
            - Retinal ischaemia → new vessel growth
            - Abnormal new vessels form; friable vessels
            - Can lead to [[Retinal detachment]]
            - Can cause macula oedema

- Management
    - 🍒What should be done to reduce the risk or slow the progression of diabetic retinopathy
        - Optimise glycaemic profile, blood lipids and blood pressure
        - Encourage smoking cessation
        -  Fenofibrate and statin
        
        ---
        
        - Fenofibrate should be added regardless of blood lipid levels
        
    - Anti-VEGF inhibitors (intravitreal injfections; ranibizumab)
    - Vitrectomy
    - Photocagulation (laser → stops vessel growth)
