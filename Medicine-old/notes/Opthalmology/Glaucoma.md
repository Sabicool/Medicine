- Questions
    
    ![[1000002783.jpg]]
    
- 🍒What is considered normal intraocular pressure?
    
    10-20 mmHg
    
- Aqueous humour fills the anterior and posterior chamber (both at the front of the eye)
    - Divided by the iris
- Epithelium of the ciliary muscle secretes produces aqueous humour into the posterior chamber
    
    - The ciliary muscle epithelium is stimulated `sympathetically on beta-receptors` to increase production of aqueous humour
    
    - Posterior chamber → anterior chamber → trebecular network → canal of schlemm
- Intraocular pressure is measured using tonometry
- Autonomic nervous system influence:
    - 🍒The `parasympathetic` system acts to `decrease` intraocular pressure
        
        Constricts ciliary muscle → allows fluid to drain → decreases pressure
        
    - 🍒The `sympathetic` system acts to `increase` intraocular pressure
        
        Produces fluid allowing the eye to focus
        
- High intraocular pressure results in optic neuropathy
- 🍒What is the pattern of vision loss in glaucoma?
    
    Peripheral first, central last
    
- Closed angle glaucoma
    - Acute

        - Clinical features
            
            - Symptoms
                - Angle for drainage suddenly closes; abrupt onset
                - Painful red eye
                    - Pain is described to be at the “back” of the eye
                - Blurred vision with halos
                - Eye is firm (”rock hard”)
            - Symptoms are triggered when the pupil dilates, because dilation of the pupil closes the angle for drainage (e.g. entering a dark room, drug with dilating side effect (scopolamine, [[Atropine]])
            
            - 🍒In acute angle closure glaucoma, the eyes are `firm` on palpation
            - 🍒Symptoms of acute angle closure glaucoma are classically aggravated when `entering a dark room`
                
                Due to papillary dilation causing the angle to close further. Drugs that dilate the pupil also have a similar effect (e.g. atropine)
                
        - Management
            
            - Medical management is trialled while awaiting surgery (surgery is definitive treatment); may stabilise intraocular pressure and reduce side effects; all used together
                - [[Acetazolamide]]
                - [[Mannitol]]
                - Timolol ([[Beta blocker]])
                - Pilocarpine ([[Muscuranic antagonists]])
            - Can never use epinephrine in closed angle because it dilates pupil → worsens angle
            
            - 🍒What is the immediate management of acute angle closure glaucoma
                
                Head up — at least 30 degrees
                
                **IV Acetazolamide (carbonic anhydrase inhibitor)**
                
                Timolol (beta-blocker)
                
                Pilocarpine (cholinergic antagnoist)
                
                Apraclonidine (alpha2-agnoist)
                
                ---
                
                In addition to symptomatic treatment of pain and nausea and vomiting
                
                if IOP and visual acuity have not improved in 1 hour, consider mannitol (e.g. 1-2 g/kg IV over 45 minutes)
                
    - Chronic
        - Portion of the angle is blocked
        - Develops scarring
        - Intraocular pressure not as high
        - Fewer symptoms (pain) → delayed presentation
            - More damage to the optic nerve
        - Diagnosis made when peripheral vision loss occurs
- Primary Open Angle Glaucoma

    - Chronic → most patients have this form
    - Overproduction of fluid or decreased drainage
    - No symptoms until loss of vision occurs
    - Can be secondary to [[Uveitis]], trauma, chronic steroid usage, prior retinopathy)
    - Risk factors
        - Age
        - Family history
        - African-american
    
    - 🍒On fundoscopy, open angle glaucoma appears with `cupping of the optic disc`
    
    - Management
        
        - M3 agonists → contracts ciliary muscle → increases drainage
        - Alpha agonists/Beta blockers → block ciliary epithelium from releasing aqueous humour
        - Prostaglandin analogues → vasodilate Cansls of Schlemm → increase outflow
            - Might darken iris
        - Carbonic anhydrase inhibitor → decrease synthesis of aqueous humour
            - Mild diuretic
        
        - 🍒What is the management of primary open angle glaucoma?
            
            Medical:
            
            Topical beta blockers (timolol)
            
            Topical prostaglandin analogue (latanoprost, bimatoprost)
            
            Topical alpha-adrenergic agonist (epinephrine, brimonidine)
            
            Carbonic anhydrase inhibitor
            
            Surgical (after acute attack subsided):
            
            Laser iridotomy (? 1st line)
            
            Surgical iridectomy
            
            Trabeculoplasty
            
            Trabeeculectomy
            
- Congenital glaucoma
