- Can be central or branch retinal vein
- Branch retinal vein occlusion
    - Pathophysiology
        - Compression of the branch vein by retinal arterioles
        - Associated with arteriosclerosis
        - Arteries and veins run together in an arteriovenous sheath
- Central retinal vein occlusion
    - Usually due to a primary thrombus disorder
- Non-ischaemic CRVO presents with painless, unilateral loss of vision, no afferent pupillary defect and less severe fundoscopic fundings in comparison to ischemic CRVO
