        [[Iridocyclitis]]
        
    - Intermediate uvea
        
        [[Vitreous humor inflammation]]
        
        [[Vitritis]]
        
    - Posterior uveitis: painless, floaters and decreased vision
        
        [[Retinitis]]
        
        [[Choroiditis]]
        
        [[Chorioretintiits]]
        
- Aetiology
    
    - üçíIn what patient description would you consider uveitis in?
        
        Young person with unilateral red eye, glare and photosensitivity with a background of ankylosing spondylitis/immune condition and recent viral condition
