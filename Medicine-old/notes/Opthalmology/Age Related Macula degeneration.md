- üçíWhat is the pattern of visual disruption seen in macula degeneration
    
    Distortion (metamorphopsia)
    
    Loss of central vision (central scotomas)
    
- Diagnosed with:
    - Fundoscopy primarily
    - Can also use asmler grid test
- Dy macula degeneration
    
    - More common (80%)
    - Gradual decrease in vision
    
    - Pathophysiology
        - Bruch‚Äôs membrane: innermost layer of the choroid (between choroid and retina)
        - Retinal pigment epithelium: retina layer beneath photoreceptors (next to choroid (Bruch‚Äôs membrane)
        - Accumulation of drusen between above two layers
    
    - Management
        - üçíWhat is the management of dry macula degeneration
            - Vitamin and antioxidant supplements may prevent
                - ‚áí Eat a healthy, well-balanced diet rich in antioxidants
            - Keep a healthy lifestyle
            - Don‚Äôt smoke
    - Fundoscopy appearance
        
        - fundoscopy appearance with drusen

- Wet macula degeneration
    - Less common
    - Rapidly (day/weeks) progresses to vision loss
    - Pathophysiology
        - Break in Bruch‚Äôs membrane
        - Blood vessels form beneath the retina which leak and haemorrhage
    - Management
        - üçíWhat is the first line management of wet macula degeneration
            
            - Anti-VEGF (ranibizumab)

            Second line:
            
            - Laser coagulation: direct thermal coagulation of neovascularisation
            - Photodynamic therapy
    - Fundoscopy appearance
        
        - fundoscopy appearance with haemorrhage at the macula
