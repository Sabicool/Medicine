- Classification ^d07c1d
	- Based on ECG and Biomakers
		- [[Angina#Stable Angina]]
		- Acute coronary syndromes
			- [[notes/Cardiovascular/ST Elevation Myocardial Infarction (STEMI)]]
			- Non-ST Elevation Acute Coronary Syndromes (NSTEACS)
				- [[Non ST Elevation Myocardial Infarction (NSTEMI)]] :: myocardial infarction present (elevated cardiac biomarkers)
				- [[Angina#Unstable Angina]] :: patients without elevated cardiac biomarkers
	- Based on Aetiology
		- Type 1 Myocardial Infarction
			- Atherothrombotic coronary occlusion (most commonly secondary to coronary plaque disruption e.g. rupture or erosion) compromises myocardial blood flow
		- Type 2 Myocardial Infarction
			- Secondary to an imbalance between the myocardial oxygen supply and demand.
			- Can be due to coronary artery spasm, [[Aortic dissection]] or embolism as well as tachyarrhythmias
- ECG changes in ACS
    - Acute changes
        - ST elevation ‚Üí acute injury
        - T wave inversion ‚Üí ischaemia
        - Q waves ‚Üí infarction
    - Inferior MI: II, III, and AVF
    - Anterior MI: I, aVL and V1-3 (anterioseptal) or V4-6 (anterolateral)
- üçíWhat should be done within the first 10 minutes in any patients presenting with suspected ACS?
    An ECG
