- Different types
	- 3 lead
		- What are the benefits and drawbacks of a 3 lead ECG?
			- Poorly sensitive for ST segment changes
			- Good for atrial arrhythmia detection (in lead II) and R wave changes
	- 5 lead
		- What are the benefits of a 5 lead ECG?
			- Addition of V1 enhances atrial dysrhthymia detection
			- Addition of V4, V5 improves detection of ischaemic events

	- Basics
		- Callibration
			- Calibration spike should be 2 large square tall and 1 large square across
			- 1 large square = 200 msec
			- 1 small square = 40 msec
		- Rate (and regularity)
			- $\rm{Heart\; Rate}=\frac{300}{R-R\; interval\; (large\; squares)}$
			- Count number of QRS complexes in rhythym strip and multiply by 6
		- Rhythm
			- The place where the action potential starts
			- Sinus rhythm = action potential starts at the sinus node
				- P waves upright in lead II
				- P waves inverted in lead aVR
				- Each P wave looks the same (within the same lead)
			- Atrial rhythm = action potential starts somewhere in the atria (not SA or AV node)
			- AV nodal rhythm (junctional rhythm = action potential starts at the AV node
		- Axis
			- Average direction of the electrical potential during depolarisation of the ventricles
			- ![[images/ECG Interpretation.png]]
			- Always compare to the TP line
		- P wave
			- Size (e.g. Tall in right atrial enlargement (>2.5 mm))
			- Shape (e.g. Bifid in left atrial enlargement)
			- Followed by a QRS (e.g. heart block)
			- ![[images/ECG Interpretation-1.png|300]]
		- PR interval
			- Beginning of P wave to start of QRS complex
			- Normal range = 120-200 msec (3-5 small squares)
			- Prolonged (>1 big square) (e.g. in heart block)
			- Short (<3 small squares) = pre-excitation rhythm (e.g. [[notes/Cardiovascular/Wolff-Parkinson-White Syndrome|Wolff-Parkinson-White Syndrome]])
			- 
		- QRS complex
		- ST segments
		- T waves
		- QT interval
- Wellen Syndrome
	- Deeply inverted or biphasic T waves in V2-3
	- Rest of the ECG may be normal
	- Admit and antiplatelets
	- Be vigilant for chest pain and ECG changes
	- Urgent cath (not emergenct PCI)
