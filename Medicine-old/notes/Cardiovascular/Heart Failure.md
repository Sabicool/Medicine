[[Decompensated Heart Failure Workup]]
Medicines that lead to fluid retention can be dangerous, including corticosteroids and NSAIDs such as selective COX-2 inhibitors. Medicines with negative inotropic effects (verapamil and diltiazem) may also precipitate heart failure symptoms.
Thiazolidinediones used in the management of type 2 diabetes may worsen heart failure. Rosiglitazone is contraindicated for patients with a history of heart failure, but pioglitazone can be used with caution by patients with New York Heart Association class I heart failure.
