- Aetiologies
    
    - üçíThe most common cause of secondary hypertension in adults is `primary aldosteronism`
    
    - Most common causes in adults include:
        - <40 years of age: thyroid dysfunction, fibromuscular dysplasia, and renal parenchymal disease
            - Most common causes in children and adolescents (<18 years of age) include renal parenchymal disease and coarctation of the aorta
            - Women <40 should be assessed for renal artery stenosis caused by fibromuscular dysplasia
        - 40‚Äì64 years of age: hyperaldosteronism, thyroid dysfunction, and **obstructive sleep apnoea**
        - ‚â• 65 years of age: renal artery stenosis
    
    - Can be remembered by RECENT:
        - **R**enal (e.g., renal artery stenosis, glomerulonephritis, CKD, nephrotic syndrome, PKD)
        - **E**ndocrine (e.g., Cushing syndrome, hyperthyroidism, Conn syndrome (hyperaldosteronism), pheochromocytoma)
        - **C**oarctation of the aorta ‚Üí hypertension in upper limbs + weak/absent pulses in lower limbs
        - o**E**strogen (oral contraceptives)
        - **N**eurological (raised intracranial pressure, psychostimulants use)
        - **T**reatment (e.g., glucocorticoids, NSAIDs, ciclosporin and atypical antipsychotics)
    
    - Other causes:
        - Chronic alcohol excess
        - Illicit drug use
        - Also consider white coat hypertension
    
    - Hypertensive emergencies
        - Hypertensive encephalopathy: severe hypertension w/ headache, vomiting, visual disturbance, mental status changes, seizure and papilloedema
        - Hypertensive left ventricular failure: Sx: decompensated cardiac failure ‚áí SOB, APO, lethargy, frothy pink sputum + can lead to bi-ventricular failure ‚áí peripheral oedema & hepatomegaly
        - Acute aortic dissection: acute severe chest pain w/ ripping/tearing characteristics ¬± radiation to back/jaw + **interarm blood pressure diff. of >20mmHg is suggestive** (not diagnostic)
- Hypertensive retinopathy
    - Fundoscopy is characterised by:
        
        - Arteriolar narrowing
        - Arterior venous nipping (constriction of veins at crossing points)
        - ‚ÄúCotton wool spots‚Äù on the retina (d/t ischaemic changes)
        - Flame haemorrhages or papilloedema

- Investigations
    - Initial investigations
        - ECG (previous MI or LVH is a key prognostic factor)
        - CXR ‚Üí cardiomegaly, widening of the L subclavian border and a double bulge at the site of the aortic knuckle ‚Üí coarctation of the aorta
        - Blood tests: urea, electrolytes, creatinine, random blood sugar, serum cholesterol
        - Urine dip stick ‚Üí glycosuria and proteinuria, and presence of casts
    - Subsequent investigations
        - Imaging
            - Unilateral small kidney ‚Üí chronic pyelonephritis or renal artery stenosis
            - Bilateral shrunken kidney ‚Üí CKD
    - Sleep apnoea/obesity hypoventilation syndrome
        - 1st: Epworth sleepiness scale ‚â•11
        - Other tests: ABG, nocturnal polysomnography
    - Conn syndrome/hyperaldosteronism
        - Low plasma potassium (not present in the majority of pts, can be falsely low in pts w/ diuretics)
        - Decreased plasma renin activity
- Management> [!important]  
    > ACE-i are 1st line in nephrotic syndrome (as they also reduce proteinuria)
