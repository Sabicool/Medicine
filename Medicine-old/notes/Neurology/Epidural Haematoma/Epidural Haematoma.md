- Aetiology
    - 🍒Classically it is taught that epidural haematomas result from blunt force trauma to the temporal region along the distribution of the `middle meningeal artery`

    - 🍒Epidural haematomas are more likely to be caused by injuries to `venous` structures in children

- Prognostic factors
    - 🍒What clinical findings are associated with a worse prognosis for epidural haematomas?
        
        - Low GCS (3-5)
        - **Bilateral** fixed pupils

- Imaging
    - 🍒Fresh blood has `lower` attenuation than clotted blood in a CT of a haematoma

- Management
    - 🍒An epidural haematoma `≥30cm``$^3$`﻿ should be surgically evacuated regardless of GCS score
