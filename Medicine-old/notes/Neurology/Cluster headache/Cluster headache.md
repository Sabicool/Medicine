> Cluster headache is known as a 'suicide headache’ because the pain is so severe. Urgently refer a patient with suspected cluster headache for expert review, to confirm the diagnosis and optimise treatment—if the patient is having an acute attack, send them to an emergency department.

        Cluster headache is known as a 'suicide headache’ because the pain is so severe
        
    - 🍒What are the additional symptoms apart from pain in cluster headaches
        
        Ipsilateral autonomic symptoms: conjunctival injections and/or lacrimations, rhinorrhoea and nasal congestion, partial horner syndrome (ptosis and miosis no anhidrosis)
        
        Muscle tension
        
        Phono/photophobia
        
        Restlessness and agitation

        While patients with [[Migraine]] headaches tend to rest motionlessly in a quiet, dark room, individuals with cluster headache pace around restlessly in excruciating pain!
        
    - 🍒What are the exacerbating features of cluster headaches
        
        No exacerbating factors. Some triggers exist:
        
        Alcohol
        
        Histamine
        
        Seasonal fluctuations
        
        Nitroglycerine
        
    - 🍒What is the timing and onset of cluster headaches
        
        30-40 minutes per attach with 0.5-8 attacks everyday.
        
- Management
    - 🍒What is the management of cluster headaches in the GP setting
        
        If acute attack: referral to emergency department
        
        If suspected to have it: referral (presumably to neurologist)
        
    - 🍒What is the acute management of cluster headaches?
        
        [[Triptan (-triptan)]]
        
        1st line: sumatriptan subcutaneously
        
        2nd line: sumatriptan intranasally
        
        Also consider: high flow oxygen 100% 15L/minute by inhalation in nonrebreathing mask
        
    - 🍒What is the bridging treatment for cluster headaches
        
        Short course of oral prednisolone
        
        ---
        
        Other options include greater occipital nerve block and naratriptan
        
    - 🍒What is the prophylactic management of cluster headache
        
        [[Verapamil]] but need to do ECG first
        
        ---
        
        Other options include topiramate, sodium valproate, gabapentin and melatonin (high dose)
        
        In predictable episodic can build up dose in 2 to 6 weeks before onset and then taper 1 month after they are predicted to resolve. In chronic, can be used continusouly
