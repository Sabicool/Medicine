- Aetiology and pathophysiology
    - Caused by impaired endolymph resorption
    - Exact cause unknown; viral, autoimmune, allergies
- Epidemiology
    - Equal in males and females
    - Commonly affects 30-60 years old
    - Uncommon: 1 in 1000
- Clinical features
    - 🍒What is the triad of symptoms for Ménière disease?
        
        Peripheral vertigo
        
        Tinnitus
        
        Asymmetric fluctuating sensorineural hearing loss
        
        ---
        
        Low-mid frequency hearing loss that progressively worsens with each episode
        
        Weber test lateralised to healthy ear (SNHL in opposite ear)
        
        Rinne test bilaterally positive (AC > BC bilaterally)
        
    - 🍒What additional symptoms apart from vertigo might be present in Ménière disease?
        
        Spontaneous horizontal or horizontal rotatory nystagmus
        
        Nausea and vomiting
        
        Sensation of aural fullness
        
- Diagnostics
    
    - From Amboss:
        - Definite Meniere disease: must include all of the following criteria
            - ≥ 2 spontaneous attacks of vertigo, each lasting 20 min to 12 hrs
            - Low to mid-frequency sensorineural hearing loss in the affected ear on audiometry
            - Fluctuating aural symptoms in the affected ear (hearing loss, tinnitus, or ear fullness)
            - Other suspected causes of vertigo excluded
    
    - 🍒Which frequencies would you expect decreased hearing in Ménière disease?
        
        Low-mid frequency

- Management
    
    - No cure; symptomatic and prevent recurrence
    
    - 🍒What is the acute management of vertigo in Ménière disease?
        
        Symptomatic: Prochlorperazine (and other vestibular suppressants)
        
        Consider movement restriction to decrease falls risk (rest quietly, avoid sudden changes, do not read, avoid glaring lights)
        
        ---
        
        Do not use for prolonged periods of time
        
    - 🍒What are prophylactic measures (non-pharm and pharm) for managing Ménière disease?
        
        Aim: reduce sodium and water content of endolymph
        
        Restric salt to <3 grams daily
        
        Identification and avoidance of triggers (e.g. caffeine, alcohol, stress) → consider diary
        
        [[Thiazide and thiazide-like diuretics]] ⇒ hydrochlorothiazide
        
        ±[[Potassium-sparing diuretic]] ⇒ amiloride, triamterene
