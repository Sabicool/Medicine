[[Emphysema]]

- Management (as by NPS Modules for infective exacerbation with H. flu)
    - Salbutamol
    - Ipratropium
    - Doxycycline (because of amoxicillin sensitivity)
    - Prednisolone
    - Nicotine (smoker with moderate dependence)
- In general:
    - Oxygen supplementation, salbutamol and stat dose of prednisolone
    - Amoxicillin if bacterial infective exacerbation suspected
    - Add ipratropium if not responding to salbutamol
