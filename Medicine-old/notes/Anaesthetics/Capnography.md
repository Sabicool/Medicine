- Measurement of exhaled $\ce{CO2}$
- End tidal $\ce{CO2}$ is quite important but also note the shape of the trace
	- Bronchospasm = upsloping shape
	- Significant hypotension can cause ET$\ce{CO2}$ to fall
	- Can be measure of the adequacy of CPR and indicator of return of spontaneous circulation (ET$\ce{CO2}$ during CPR should be >10; if sudden increase, then likely has return of spontaneous circulation)
	- Oesophageal intubation = disconnected circuit (absent ET$\ce{CO2}$)
	- Exhausted $\ce{CO2}$ absorbent = ET$\ce{CO2}$ does not return to 0-5
- Apnoeic patients: ET$\ce{CO2}$ increases by 6 mmHg after 1 minute and increases by 3 mmHg every minute thereafter

# Reasons for Drop in ET$\ce{CO2}$
- Decreased $\ce{CO2}$ elimination
	- Acute cardiovascular collapse
	- Massive venous air embolism
	- Large pulmonary embolism
	- Kinked, dislodged or oesophageal endotracheal tube
- Decreased $\ce{CO2}$ production
	- Hypothermia
	- Hypothyroidism
	- Neuromuscular blockade
- Circuit sampling line disconnect

# Other Measures of ET$\ce{CO2}$

- Colour change from purple to yellow indicates presence of CO2 > 2%
- A pH detector (metacresol purple on filter paper) detects pH shifts and changes to the colour yellow in the presence of expired CO2
