- Advise no sexual contact for **7 days** after treatment is commenced, or until the course is completed and symptoms resolved, whichever is later.
- Advise no sex with partners from the last **3 months** (primary syphilis), **6 months** (secondary syphilis) or **12 months** (early latent) until the partners have been tested and treated if necessary.
Review all patients clinically and with repeat RPR testing at **3 months**, then at **6 months** and (if necessary) at **12 months** after completing treatment. A 4-fold drop (e.g. 1:8 to 1:2) indicates adequate response to treatment.
