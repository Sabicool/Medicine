        When googled:
        
        > [!important]  
        > There is a 2-fold increased risk of cleft palateÂ associated with ondansetron taken for NVP in the first trimester of pregnancy  
        
        But SOMANZ says there is conflicting data
        
    - Corticosteroids> [!important]  
        > Withold until after 10 weeks due to possible increased risk of oral clefts
