- Main Source RANZCOG Guidelines
	- Mainly taken from [RANZCOG Guidelines](https://ranzcog.edu.au/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Management-of-Postpartum-Haemorrhage-PPH.pdf)
- Definitions
    - PPH is defined as blood loss of {{c1::â‰¥500 mL}} during peurperium
        - Severe PPH used to be defined as â‰¥1000, but now defined as causing haemodynamic compromise regardless of estimated blood loss
    - **Primary** PPH is described as occurring {{c1::within 24 hours of delivery}} whereas **secondary** PPH is {{c1::between 24 hours and 6 weeks postpartum}}
    - KEMH definitions
         - ![[Untitled 78.png|Untitled 78.png]]
- Aetiology
     - ![[Untitled 1 39.png|Untitled 1 39.png]]
     - **Uterine atony** is the most common cause of primary PPH
-  The blood flow to the placental bed varies with gestation but is approximately 750 ml/min at term. Given that maternal blood volume may only be approximately 7 litres and blood loss may be life-threatening with unreplaced volume loss of as little as 30%, it can be seen that a mother can become critically unwell in just a few minutes  
- Management
    - Prophylaxis
        - {{c1::Single dose oxytocin}} should remain the drug of choice for PPH prophylaxis following vaginal or caesarean birth in women **without risk factors** for PPH
        - The notable side effect of **syntometrine (ergometrine + oxytocin)** is {{c1::vomiting}}
    - Severe PPH
        - Resuscitation (Call for help, A: high flow oxygen, B, C: wide bore IV access x2 blood sent for FBC, coags and x match + rapid infusion of warmed fluids and group specific or group O- blood)
        - 5 Tâ€™s
			- Tone (i.e. if atony)
                - Mechanical:: uterine massage or bimanual uterine compression

                - Pharmacological (following are often given in combination)
                    
                    - Oxytocin:: 5 units oxytocin by slow IV or IV infusion (e.g. 40 units oxytocin in 500mL normal saline over 4 hours)
                    - Ergometrine:: 0.25mg by slow IV or IM injection repeated 5 minutely up to maximum 1.0mg
                    
                    - Other accessed through TGA special access scheme
                        - Carboprost; Prostinfenem: IM 0.25mg every 15 minutes to a maximum total dose of 2.0mg (i.e. 8 times)
                
                - Surgical see
            - Trauma
                - Inspect and apply pressure
                - Attempt repair either in labour ward or operating theatre
                - If vaginal bleeding normal but shocked consider intra-abdominal sources e.g. ruptured uterus, broad ligament haematoma, ruptured spleen etc
            - Tissue (retained placenta, cotyledon or membranes)
                
                - Controlled cord traction
                
                - Empty bladder and transfer to theatre â†’ manual removal of placenta â†’ uterine exploration

                    a bit mad
                    
            - Thrombin (abnormalities of coagulation)
                - Tranexamic acid 1g IV repeated after 30 minutes if persistent
                    - Only be given in the context of overall patient management
                - Replacement of platelets and clotting factors
                - Manage specific abnormalities (e.g. von Willebrand the homie, thrombocytopenia)
            - Theatre (obviously for uterine rupture, placenta accreta massive haemorrhage)
                
                - Balloon tamponade (many balloons exist, not high yield enough to go through)
                
                - Haemostatic brace suturing (such as B-lynch suture)
                    
                    **Uterine atony**Â _unresponsive_Â to medical management may respond to a(n) {{c1::B-lynch compression}} suture during exploratory laparotomy

                - Bilateral ligation of uterine arteries
                - Bilateral ligation of internal iliac arteries
                - Other arterial embolisation (not often done, especially at a shit hospital like KEMH cuz thereâ€™s no interventional radiologists)
                - Hysterectomy (should be first line instead imo)

        When are the following uterotonic drugs contraindicated?  
          
        Methylergonovine/Ergometrine: {{c1::hypertension}}  
        Carboprost: {{c1::asthma}}  
        Extra:  
        Prostaglandin and its analogues are the most potent of the uterotonics but also have the most serious adverse effect profile which includes severe hypertension and bronchospasm (therefore contraindicated where there is a significant history of asthma)  
        
    - When to do Kleihauer test
        
        _ngl, this card kinda low yield_
        
        A Kleihauer test should be done in the context of anterpartum haemorrhage when there is:  
          
        {{c1::Rhesus negative  
        CTG with sinusoidal pattern  
        Non-reactive CTG with reduced variability + inactive fetus}}
