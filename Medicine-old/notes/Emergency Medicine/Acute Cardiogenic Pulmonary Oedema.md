- Acute cardiogenic pulmonary oedema presents as rapid onset of severe dyspnoea (often first occurring at night) as well as tachypnoea and tachycardia
    - Other features include:
        - Poor peripheral perfusion
        - Widespread lung crackles (+/- wheezes)
- Management
    - Outpatient setting
        - 🍒What is the management of acute cardiogenic pulmonary oedema in the outpatient setting?
            - Furosemide 20-80mg IV or IM repeated 20 minutes later if necessay
            - High flow oxygen via mask with reservoir (if oxygen <92%)
        - 🍒What should be added to management of acute cardiogenic pulmonary oedema if clinical response is inadequate to oxygen and furosemide therapy in the outpatient setting?
            
            - Glyceryl trinitrate spray or tablet
            
            ---
            
            Use nitrates with caution in patients with systolic blood pressure below 100 mmHg, symptomatic hypotension or signs of poor perfusion
            
    - Inpatient setting
        
        - Consider [[Acute Coronary Syndromes]], [[Hypertensive emergency]], arrhthmias, mechanical cardiac causes (e.g. [[Mitral regurgitation]]) or acute [[Pulmonary Embolism]]
        
        - 🍒What is the management of acute cardiogenic pulmonary oedema in the inpatient setting?
            - Oxygen, IV access and ECG, blood pressure and pulse oximetry monitoring
            - Furosemide 20-80mg IV repeated 20 minutes later if necessary
            - +/- indewelling catheter to mintor urine output
            - +/- gylceryl trinitrate infusion
        - 🍒What should be added to management of acute cardiogenic pulmonary oedema if clinical response is inadequate to oxygen, furosemide gtn therapy in the inpatient setting
            - Continuous positive airway pressure ventilation starting at 10cm of water pressure
        - 🍒What should be added to management of acute cardiogenic pulmonary oedema if the patient has [[Atrial Fibrilation]] with rapid ventricular rate that is thought to be contributing to poor cardiac output?
            
            - Amiodarone 300mg by IV infusion over 30-60 minutes
            
            ---
            
            If not responding or patient deteriorating → consider electrical cardioversion
            
        - 🍒What should be added to management of acute cardiogenic pulmonary oedema if patient is not responding to other measures and is hypotensive or poorly perfused
            
            Dobutamine 2.5-15 micrograms/kg/minute by IV infusion
            
            ---
            
            Consider [[Cardiogenic shock]] and intubation
