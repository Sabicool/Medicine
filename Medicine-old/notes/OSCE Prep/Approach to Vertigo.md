- Red flags
    
    Stroke and acute obstructive hydrocephalus caused by a posterior fossa tumor are medical emergencies and require immediate management
    
    - 🍒What are the red flag pathologies and symptoms for new onset vertigo?
        
        Stroke or TIA if central vertigo
        
        Acute bacterial [[Vestibular Labyrinthitis]] suggested by unilateral hearing loss, acute [[Otitis Media]], vertigo, pain and/or fever
        
        Sudden unilateral sensorineural hearing loss (see [[Approach to Hearing Loss]]

    - 🍒What is your approach to an OSCE station with the presenting complaint of vertigo?
        
        Can remember simply as **T**i**T**ra**TE** ⇒ **T**iming (acute vs episodic vs chronic) → **T**riggers (positional vs spontaneous vs trauma) → **T**argeted **E**xamination (HINTS or Dix-Hallpike)
        
        1. Determine if episode is vertigo and take history:
            
            Onset, duration, room spinning
            
            Associated symptoms: nausea, vomiting, otorrhoea, hearing loss, tinnitus, headache, **history of migraine**
            
            - Vertigo (room spinning): illusion of movement; e.g. horizontal and rotatory
            - Dysequilibrium (unsteady): brain receives inadequate information about the body's position from the somatosensory, visual, and vestibular systems
            - Lightheadedness (faint): see [[Approach to a pre-syncope-syncope]]
            
            Medications
            
        2. Focused exam
            
            Blood pressure, temperature
            
            Otoscopy (consider [[Herpes zoster oticus]])
            
            Cardiovascular exam (bruits, murmurs, rhythym)
            
            Neuro exam (gait, balance, eye movements, coordination, CN exam)
            
            If sudden onset constant vertigo (i.e. acute vestibular syndrome) ⇒ HINTS+ (plus = hearing
            
        3. Determine if central or peripheral
            
            If episodic related to position/movement→ Dix-Hallpike (+ve ⇒ [[Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo (BPPV)]], -ve ⇒ [[Orthostatic hypotension]]
            
        4. Investigations
            
            BGL; Others not routine
            
    - 🍒What are the “Dangerous D’s” you should look out for that suggest a central cause of vertigo
        
        Dysphagia, dysarthria, diplopia and dysmetria
        
        ---
        
        Helps differentiate AICA stroke and labyrinthitis
        
    - 🍒How do you interpret HINTS positive result
        
        Positive HINTS = peripheral cause
        
        Negative HINTS = central cause
        
    - 🍒How many positive results are required for the HINTS assessment to suggest a benign peripheral cause
        
        All need to suggest peripheral cause. If any 1 suggests central ⇒ further workup is required
        
        ---
        
        Presence of **ANY** of the following strongly suggests central vertigo: normal head impulse test, any central-type nystagmus (e.g., direction-changing, vertical, or torsional nystagmus), AND/OR skew deviation  
        Presence of  
        **ALL** of the following suggests peripheral vertigo: abnormal head impulse test, only peripheral-type nystagmus (e.g., spontaneous unidirectional horizontal nystagmus), AND no skew deviation
        
    - 🍒What features on HINTS exam suggest a central cause?
        
        _Remember: INFARCT (e.g. stroke)_
        
        **I**mpulse **N**ormal
        
        **F**ast-phase **A**lternative (direction of nystagmus changes with gaze change at extremities or vertical)
        
        **R**e-fixation on **C**over **T**est (vertical strabismus)
        
        ---
        
        **Any** of the above ⇒ central → neuroimaging
        
    - 🍒What features on HINTS exam suggest a peripheral cause
        
        Abnormal head impulse
        
        No nystagmus or unidirectional nystagmus
        
        No vertical skew (some horizontal fixation is normal)
        
        ---
        
        **All** of the above required for peripheral
        
    - 🍒For which patient group is a HINTS exam indicated?
        
        Symptomatic patients with acute vestibular syndrome
        
        ---
        
        Performing while asymptomatic ⇒ false negative (i.e. suggesting central)
        
        Purpose of HINTS is to screen for central cause
        
    - 🍒What is in the PLUS in the HINTS+ exam and what does it investigate for?
        
        Finger rub test next to each ear → new hearing loss → [[AICA stroke]]
        
        ---
        
        AICA supplies both peripheral and central structures so AICA territory infarct can appear benign (i.e. peripheral). Which brings the question how to differentiate labyrinthitis from AICA stroke. I presume this is through other focal neuro symptoms.
        
    - 🍒Do you ever perform HINTS and Dix Hallpike on the same patient
        
        Never!

- Management
    - 🍒What is your approach to management in an OSCE station that presents with vertigo
        1. Manage any red flags (central, acute bacterial labyrinthitis)
        2. If peripheral with sudden onset asymmetric sensorineural hearing loss ⇒ consider high dose corticosteroids - ENT referral
        3. Manage peripheral cause:
            
            Symptomatic management of acute vertigo with prochlorperazine (oral/IM)
            
            Manage peripheral causes: BPPV, Vestibular neuronitis, Ménière disease
            
        4. Discuss driving implications ⇒ esp for Ménière disease and commercial drivers
        5. Persistent vertigo → referral for non-acute ENT or vestibular physiotherapy
    - 🍒What imaging should you request to workup a central cause of vertigo
        
        MRI brain with or without magnetic resonance angiogram
        
        ---
        
        MRI brain is better than CT for detecting acute ischaemic changes (especially in early presentation). Can also detect demyelinating conditions
        
- Extra
    - HINTS assessment information
        
        Rapid rotation towards the centre; make patient unaware of which direction by changing speed + direction
        
        Nystagmus: follow finger (breakdown of smooth pursuits) + hold eyes in lateral position for a few seconds (can hold hand on head)
        
        Skew: alternate cover ⇒ look for vertical strabismus while fixating on nose (horizontal fixation is normal)
