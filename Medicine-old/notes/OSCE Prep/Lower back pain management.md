See: [[Non Specific Low Back Pain]]
- 🍒What is your approach to management of non-specific low back pain including radiculopathy and spinal canal stenosis
    
    Non-pharm
    
    Patient education:
    
    - Tell patient that history and exam didn’t reveal serious problems
    - Most people recover in a few weeks (6-12) with improvement and pain
    - Disability expected up to 12 months
    - Staying active helps your back to recover
    - Imaging tests are not needed
    - ‼️Pain does not mean harm
    
    Active self management:
    
    - Resume or maintain normal activity and movement
    - Avoid bed rest for >2 days → delays recovery
    - Return early to work, even if only light duties
    - Trial heat or ice therapy, depending on what offers relief
    
    Pharm
    
    - Simple analgesia (paracetamol and/or NSAIDs) at regular dosing
    
    Discharge/Safety netting:
    
    - Review in 24 hours if significant pain in initial presentation
    - Review every 1 to 2 weeks to check improvement in pain and disability → discuss prevention strategies
        - If no improvement → second line care (e.g. physical therapy, weight loss, smoking cessation, CBT)
        - Consider weak oral opioids (tramadol) if no improvement with first line analgesia
