- What the disease is
    - 🍒When explaining croup to a parent, how might you explain the cause?
        
        Croup is a common viral infection of the upper airway at the voice box (larynx) and windpipe (trachea). Is a problem in children who have narrow air passages as the infection can cause swelling making it harder to breath. It causes a barking cough and a noisy high pitched sound when they breathe (stridor).
        
        Even though not all children get croup when infected by the virus, the virus that has caused the croup can be spread easily from person to person by coughing and sneezing.
        
    - 🍒How common is croup
        
        Mostly affects children between six months and five years old, but it can affect older children. Some children get croup several times. The younger the child, the more susceptible and it tends to occur in the winter months.
        
- Management
    - 🍒What should you say to parents about when to seek medical attention
        
        Ambulance for:
        
        - your child is struggling to breathe
        - your child looks very sick and becomes pale and drowsy
        - your child’s lips are blue in colour
        - your child starts to drool or can’t swallow
        
        See a doctor for:
        
        - your child is under six months old and has signs and symptoms of croup
        - your child's breastbone or the skin between their ribs sucks when they breathe in
        - your child has stridor when at rest
        - your child is very distressed or their symptoms are getting worse
        - you are worried for any other reason
    - 🍒What should you say when explaining management of mild croup to a parent
        
        A mild attack of croup is when the child has the cough but no stridor, are calm and settled and not struggling to breathe. This can be managed at home:
        
        - Keep your child calm; sitting quietly, reading a book, or watching TV
        - Has a fever and irritable → give paracetamol or ibuprofen
        - Croup often becomes worse at night. Many children will be more settled if someone stays with them
        
        Keep at home from school
        
        Croup can worsen quickly → seek medical attention if they deteriorate
