- Overview of neck exam
    - Inspection
    - Palpation
    - Movements (active, passive and Apley’s scratch test)
    - Special tests (cervical quadrant, brachial plexus stretch, neuro upper limb and pulses)
- Procedure for inspection in the neck exam
    - In standing and then in sitting: skin abnormalities, posture of the cervical spine and scapular region, asymmetry/wasting in the neck or scapular region and arm/hand bilaterally

    - Warmth, soft tissue contours and tenderness at bony landmarks
- Procedure for movement in neck exam
    - Active is sitting: rotation (left and right)
    - Cervical flexion (upper: chin to neck, lower: chin to chest)
    - Cervical extension (upper: chin protrusion with extensio, lower: looking to ceiling)
    - Lateral flexion (R and L, tilt head sideways: ear to shoulder)
    - Shoulder movements: Apley’s scratch test
    - Passive: cervical rotation, cervical flexion, cervical extension, lateral flexion
- Procedure for special tests in neck exam
    
    - Cervical quadrant test (spurling): patient rotates their head to the side and passive extension of the neck and observe for pain on same side
    - Brachial plexus stretch test: patient seated or supine, examiner passively elevates and externally rotates straight arm and then laterally flexes head to opposite side and extends wrist
