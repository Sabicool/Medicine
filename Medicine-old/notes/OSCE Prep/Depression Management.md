- 🍒When explaining depression to a patient, how might you explain the cause?
    
    There is a difference between feeling unhappy or sad and the mental illness of depression
    
    Affects the entire mind and body → dampens everyday activities (action energy, sex drive, sleep and appetite)
    
    Cause is not fully understood, but a certain chemical is present in small amounts in the nervous system (similar to a person being low in iron and becoming anaemic); _Avoid sounding too technical_
    
    Can follow sever loss or from no apparent reason and can occur at any age.
    
- 🍒How common is depression
    
    1 in 10 patients in primary care present with depressive symptoms. 1 in 4 women and 1 in 6 men suffer from depression. Twice as common in females than males.
    
    54% recover within 6 months and 70% within one year
    
- 🍒What should you say when explaining the management of depression to a patient
    1. Step 0
        - Stop agents that may lower mood
        - Sleep hygiene, healthy diet, regular exercise
        - Relaxation
        - Smoking cessation, address substance misuse
        - Beyond blue for education/life line
    2. Step 1
        - Psychosocial interventions
            - Psycho-education
            - Low intensity interventions
            - Formal support groups, community groups
            - Employment, housing
        - Psychological therapy
            - CBT, mood gym
            - Interpersonal therapy
            - Acceptance and commitment therapy
            - Mindfulness-based cognitive therapy
        - Pharmacological
            - First-line: SSRI, NaSSA, NDRI, SNRI, NARI, melatonin agonist, serotonin modulator
            - Second-line: TCA, MAOIs
    3. Step 2
        - Increase dose of antidepressant, combine antidepressants
        - rTMS
    4. Step 3
        - Suicide action plan
    5. Step 3
        - ECT/TMS
- 🍒When starting a depressed patient on antidepressants what should you say?
    
    After starting the antidepressant, your mood should start to feel better within 2 weeks. If you develop any suicidal thoughts during this time please come back to see your GP. Once we are satisfied with the response we will then maintain the same dosage and continue antidepressants for at least a year.
    
    _If no response to antidepressants_: review diagnosis, especially considering anxiety and substance misuse which respond poorly to antidepressants
    
    Side effects to talk about:
    
    - Sexual dysfunction
    - Weight gain
    - Sleep increase
    - Stomach upset
