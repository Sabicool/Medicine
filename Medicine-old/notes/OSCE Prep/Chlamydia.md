You have an STI, specifically chlamydia. It is quite common in those <30 years. They are simple to treat and you will only need to take some antibiotics (doxycycline) for 7 days twice daily.
No sexual contact (even with protection) for 7 days after tx is started, no sex with partners from last 6 months until they have been tested/treated.
I am required to notify this to the government who collects this information to determine how often chlamydia occurs in the population. It is advised you let your sexual partners from the past 6 months know about your chlamydia infection and making sure they are also treated if they are infected too.
To prevent future STIs, ensure the use of protection during sex.
