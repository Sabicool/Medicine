- Approach
    ![[Pasted image 20240109181536.png]]
     - üçíWhat is your approach to an OSCE station with the presenting complaint of headache?
        1. Take a detailed history examining for red flags for a secondary headache
        2. Assess for features of primary headaches ([[Tension Headache]], [[Migraine]], [[Cluster headache]])
        3. Check medication usages ‚Üí [[Medication overuse headaches]]
        4. Ask about OCP, antihypertensive, alcohol and caffeine usage
        5. Consider [[Obstructive Sleep Apnoea]] if regularly wakes with a headache
        6. Recommend using a headache diary
        7. Perform neurological examination including fundoscopy:
            - Reflexes and down-going plantar response
            - Eye movements
            - Fundoscopy - Looking for papilloedema
            - Face movements and symmetry
            - Shortened cerebellar exam
        8. Blood pressure and temperature
        9. Consider investigations: CT head for features concerning mass or metastasis; CRP if >50 without past headaches ([[Giant cell arteritis-Temporal Arteritis]])

- Management
    - üçíWhat is your approach to management in an OSCE station that presents with a headache
        1. Any red flags ‚Üí ED referral
        2. Serious secondary cause ‚Üí neurological referral
        3. Primary headaches
            - Explain and discuss diagnosis
            - Address any anxiety about serious pathology
        4. Lifestyle modifications
            - Adequate hydration
            - Avoid caffeine
            - Regular meals with balanced diet
            - Good sleeping hygiene
            - Physical activity
        5. Behavioural interventions
            - Psychotherapy
            - Relaxation therapy
            - Sleep support workshops
        6. Manage primary headache accordingly
    - üçíWhat is important to screen for when you suspect [[Tension Headache]] in the OSCE?
        
        _Remember RAPE:_
        
        Relationship (e.g. recent divorce/break up)

        Performance (e.g. work or study related: exam stress)
        
        Employment status
        
        _Consider saying you‚Äôd like to do a_ _[[K10 Screening]]_ _to the examiner_
