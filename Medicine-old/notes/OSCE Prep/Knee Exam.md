- Overview of knee exam
    - General inspection
    - Gait
    - Inspection again when supine
    - Palpation
    - Palpation (in 30 degree flexion) + baker’s cyst and swipe test
    - Movements: active + passive and then extension (hold by toes and move upwards for fixed flexion deformity)
    - Special tests: patella apprehension (20-30 degree flexion), MCL and LCL (full extension and then at 30 degrees) anterior and posterior drawer, lachman’s test and McMurray’s test
- Procedure for general inspection in knee exam
    - General lower leg alignment (varus or valgus deformity)
    - Scars
- Procedure for gait in knee exam
    - Antalgic (pain)
    - Short leg
- Procedure for inspection when supine in knee exam
    - Swelling
    - Position (valgus, varus, partially flexed or hyperextended)
    - Bruised
    - Quadriceps wasting
    - Posterior sag with knee flexed at 90 degrees
- Procedure for palpation in knee exam
    - When in 30 degree of flexion: tibial tuberosity, patella tendon, patella, medial and lateral retinaculae, quadriceps tendon, medial and lateral joint lines, MCL and LCL, posterior structures: popliteal artery, Baker’s cyst, hamstring insertions and gastrocnemius origins (when prone)
    - For Baker’s cyst: warmth, tenderness fluid: swipe test
- Procedure for movements in knee exam
    - Active: flexion and extension
    - Passive: flexion: hand placed over the patella to feel for PFJ crepitus when flexiona nd returning it to resting position (extension)
    - Extension: hold both legs by the toes and look for fixed flexion or hyperextension
- Procedure for special tests in knee exam
    - Patella apprehension: knee on pillow in 20-30 degree flexion and push patella laterally
    - Stability tests: MCL and LCL apply valgus force to knee in full extension, then at 30 degree flexion looking for pain, anterior and posterior drawer test
    - Lachman’s test: knee in 15 degree flexion draw tibia anteriorly
    - McMurray’s test, knee is flexed andat various stages of IR and ER
