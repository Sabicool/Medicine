- 🍒When explaining hypertension to a patient, how might you explain the cause?
    - Use the pressure in a hose analogy
        - The further we turn up the tap and the narrower the hose, the greater the pressure
        - Pressure becomes high when heart pumps too hard and/or the arteries are too narrow
    - Sometimes caused by kidney problems or other disorders
    - Prescribed drugs (e.g. NSAIDs, OCPs) can increase BP
    - Excessive alcohol intake as well
- 🍒How common is hypertension?
    
    About 15 to 20% of the adult population in Western countries. BP tends to rise as we get older
    
- 🍒What should you say when explaining management of hypertension to a patient
    - That you would like to establish their risk
    - Trial of non-pharmacological measures (diet, decrease salt, decrease weight, reduce alcohol, avoid stress, regular exercise and quit smoking)
    - Pharmacological measures with drugs called antihypertensives
- 🍒What should you explain to patients as the possible complications of having hypertension
    - Explain that it is usually asymptomatic
    - Increases the risk of strokes and heart attacks
    - Causes the heart and kidney to wear out → heart failure and kidney failure
