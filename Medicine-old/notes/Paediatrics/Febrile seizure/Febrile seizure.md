- 🍒What conditions are required for a paediatric febrile seizure to be considered simple?
    
    All of the following:
    
    - Duration <15 minutes
    - Generalised (not focal)
    - Only 1 seizure in 24 hours/do not recur within the same febrile illness
    - Developmentally normal children
    - No neurological abnormalities post seizure
