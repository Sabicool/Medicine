- Epidemiology
    - 🍒Which is the classic description for the demographic affected by SCFE?
        
        Overweight adolescent/teenage boys
        
        ---
        
        60% in males
        
- Clinical features
    - 🍒SCFE can sometimes present as `knee` pain as the only presenting complaint
        
        It is common to see a child with months of symptoms having been treated for knee pain eventually diagnosed with a late SCFE
        
    - 🍒SCFE patients will `externally` rotate their hip when `flexed`
        
        As the hip is flexed on the affected side, the thigh will automatically externally rotate and abduct
        
- Diagnosis
    - 🍒What X-ray views should be ordered for acute SCFE?
        
        AP pelvix X-ray and a cross-table lateral X-ray
        
        **Do NOT order a frog-leg lateral X-ray →** can compromised vascular supply
        
    - 🍒What X-ray views should be ordered for chronic SCFE?
        
        AP and ‘Frog leg-lateral’ pelvic X-rays

- Management
    - 🍒What is the management in ED for SCFE?
        
        Surgical stabilisation
        
        Keep the patient non-weight bearing and admitted for surgical treatment
        
        Referral for urgent orthopaedic assessment
