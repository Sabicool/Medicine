        > Schizophrenia and schizophreniform disorder cannot be distinguished on symptoms alone; both conditions are characterised by delusions, hallucinations, disorganised speech, disorganised behaviour/catatonia and negative symptoms, all of which can be observed in this patient. The distinction between the two illnesses is time-based: symptoms need to have been present for at least one month, but less than six months in schizophreniform disorder; symptoms need to have been present for at least six months in schizophrenia. As this woman has had symptoms for seven weeks, schizophreniform disorder is the most appropriate diagnosis. Should symptoms persist beyond six months, the diagnosis may evolve into one of schizophrenia.
