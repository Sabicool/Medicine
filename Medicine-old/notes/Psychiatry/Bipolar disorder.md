- Management
    
    - Management of acute manic episode
        
        Start lithium, sodium valproate or carbamazepine simultaneously with the antipsychotic
        
        - üçíWhat is the management of acute mania in bipolar disorder?
            - Antipsychotic ‚Äî stop once acute mania symptoms remit and patient euthymic
                - Give dose at night if daytime sleepiness is an issue
            - Mood stabiliser [[Lithium]], [[Sodium valproate]], [[Carbamazepine]] ‚Äî start concurrently and continue for 6-12 months
        - üçíAre benzodiazepines recommended for the management of an acute manic episode in bipolar disorder?
            
            No because they do not address the underlying disorder that is causing the behaviour disturbance. There is good evidence for antipsychotics in the treatment of symptoms of acute mania.

    - Monitoring
        - üçíWhen is the best time to take a blood sample to test lithium concentration for dosing?
            - 5-7 days after starting treatment or each dosage change
            - 8-12 hours after the last oral dose (i.e. if BD take before second dose)
    
    - Adverse effects of lithium
        - Polyuria and polydipsia
            - Manage with potassium-sparing [Diuretics](https://www.notion.so/Diuretics-0c18d2ca6e514759aef830346898fe94?pvs=21) (e.g. amiloride) and adjust lithium dosage
        - Goitre
            - Ultrasound to assess for diffuse versus nodular enlargement
        - Hypothyroidism
            - Although lithium-induced hypothyroidism is reversible with discontinuation of lithium, **there is no need to discontinue it**, and it should not be discontinued without consultation with the patient's psychiatrist
        - Hypercalcaemia
        - Tremor (distinct from lithium toxicity tremor)
        - Weight gain
