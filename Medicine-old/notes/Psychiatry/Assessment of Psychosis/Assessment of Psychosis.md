    - Follow up
        - Positive symptoms should start to improve within 1 week of starting

        - Monitor for early warning signs of next psychotic episode:
            - Brief or mild psychotic symptoms
            - Disturbances in sleep and concentration
            - Anxiety and depression
        - Cease antipsychotic therapy once target duration is achieved
            - If symptoms last longer than 6 months ([[Schizophrenia]] or [[Schizoaffective disorder]]) or the patient has [[Delusional disorder]], continue antipsychotic therapy for **at least 2 years after symptom resolution**
            - If symptoms resolve in less than 6 months and the patient does not have delusion disorder, continue antipsychotic therapy for at least 1 year after symptom resolution
