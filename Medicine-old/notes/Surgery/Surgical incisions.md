    - Whole length of the abdomen by curving around the umbilicus
- Paramedian
    - Laterally to the linea alba provided iaccess to more lateral structures (kidney, spleen and adrenals)
    - Ligates the blood and nerve supply to muscles mediate to the incision â†’ results in their atrophy
- Kocher
