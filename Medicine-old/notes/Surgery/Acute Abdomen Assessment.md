    - Gastrointestinal: peritonitis (e.g.
    - HPB
    - Genitourinary
    - Vascular
    - Metabolic and toxic
    - MSK
- Assessment
    
    - Opioid analgesia does not increase the risk of diagnosis error or treatment decision error (and improves patient comfort)

        - Morphine in doses of 0.05 to 0.10 mg/kg intravenously (IV; typical adult dose 2 to 5 mg IV), given approximately every 15 minutes until pain is controlled
    
    - ABCDE (airway, breathing, circulation, disability and exposure)
    - Obtain IV access
    - Monitor vitals
    - Hypovolaemia should be corrected with fluids and/or blood products as indicated> [!important]  
        > Ruptured AAA or aortic dissection require careful fluid management → aggressive fluid resuscitation before surgery → ↑ peri-operative mortality  
        
    
    - Females of childbearing age should have a pregnancy test to exclude [[Ectopic pregnancy]]
        - Blood type and cross match
        - Urgent gynaecological consultation
    
    - FBC, U&E are recommended in all patients
    - Consider antifibrinolytic (e.g. TXA) to patients with suspected ongoing haemorrhage
    - Prophylactic antibiotics recommended for patients with perforated viscus, diverticulitis, appendicitis, mesenteric ischaemia or ruptured AAA
        - Rapidly develop sepsis → if possible, blood cultures should be taken before starting antibiotics
- History
    
    - The overall sensitivity and specificity of the history and physical examination in diagnosing the different causes of abdominal pain is poor (especially for benign conditions)
    - Location and radiation
    - Temporal elements
    - Quality (e.g. burning or gnawing)
    - Severity
    - Precipitants
    - Associated symptoms
        - N&V, diarrhoea, constipation, haematochezia, melaena and changes in stool
            - If RUQ → jaundice, changes in colour of stool and urine
        - Genitourinary: dysuria, frequency, haematuria
        - Constitutional: fevers, chills, fatigue, weight loss and anorexia
        - Cardiopulmonary: cough, SOB, orthopnoea, exertional dyspnoea
        - Other: Diabetic ketoacidosis → polyuria and thirst
    - Females: STIs, PID, menstrual history, vaginal discharge/bleeding, dyspareunia or dysmenorrhoea
    - Medications: e.g. NSAID use, recent antibiotic or hospitalisation → _C. difficle_
    - Social, family, travel history + sick contacts
