- 🍒What are the three most common types of hernia to strangulate in order of frequency?
    1. Femoral
    2. Indirect inguinal
    3. Umbilical
# Inguinal Hernias
- 🍒How would you differentiate between indirect and direct inguinal hernias on clinical examination (at least in theory)?
    
    Reduce the hernia and place pressure over the deep inguinal ring at the mid-point of the inguinal ligament. Ask the patient to cough:
    
    - If hernia protrudes despite occlusion ⇒ direct hernia
    - If hernia does not protrude ⇒ indirect hernia
    
    ---
    
    Often unreliable and can only be definitively differentiated at surgery

- Indirect (80%)
    
    - Bowel enters inguinal canal via the deep inguinal ring
    - Occurs as a result of incomplete closure of the processus vaginalis
        - Lateral to the inferior epigastric vessels
        - Paediatric cases are nearly always indirect
    
    - 🍒What is the management of congenital indirect inguinal hernias in infants?
        
        Herniotomy at about 1 year
        
    - 🍒What are the surgical procedures for repairing an inguinal hernia?
        - Open repairs
            - Shouldice repair
            - Bassini repair
            - Lichtenstein repair
        - Laparoscopically placing a mesh and covering the hernial orifice
    - 🍒What is involved in the shouldice repair
        
        Plicating the transversalis fascia in the posterior wall with a nylon suture
        
        ![[Untitled 5 17.png|Untitled 5 17.png]]
        
    - 🍒What is involved in the lichtenstein repair
        
        Reinforcing the posterior wall with a nylon or polypropylene **mesh**

- Direct (20%)
    
    - Bowel enters through Hesselbach’s triangle
    
    - 🍒Direct inguinal hernias pass through `Hesselbach’s` triangle
        
        ![[Untitled 8 9.png|Untitled 8 9.png]]
        
    - 🍒What are the borders of Hesselbach’s triangle?
        
        - Medial: rectus abdominis
        - Lateral: inferior epigastric vessels
        - Inferior: inguinal ligament
        
        ![[Untitled 9 8.png|Untitled 9 8.png]]
        
    
    - Occurs commonly in older patients 2° to abdominal wall laxity or significant increase in intra-abdominal pressure
        - Medial to the inferior epigastric vessels
- Risk factors
    - Male gender
    - Increasing age
    - Raised intra-abdominal pressure
    - High BMI
- Examining a inguinal hernia
    - Cough impulse
    - Location (should be superomedial to the pubic tubercle)
    - Reducible
        - If reducible, reduce and put pressure over the deep inguinal ring (at mid-point of inguinal ligament) and ask patient to cough
            - If hernia protrudes → indirect inguinal
            - If hernia does not protrude → direct inguinal
    - If it enters the scrotom, whether you can get above it/separate it from the testis
- Investigations
    - If features of obstruction and strangulation → CT imaging
    - In outpatient setting U/S is recommended as first line
- Management
    
    - A third of patients with an inguinal hernia will never experience any symptoms
    - Hernia repairs can be performed via **open repair** (Lichtenstein technique most commonly used) or **laparoscopic repair** (either total extraperitoneal (TEP) or transabdominal pre-peritoneal (TAPP))
    - **Open mesh repairs** are preferred for those with primary inguinal hernias
    - A **laparoscopic approach** is preferred in those with bilateral or recurrent inguinal hernias
        - While longer operating times, they involve quicker post-operative recovery, fewer complications and less post-operative pain

# Femoral Hernia
- 🍒What is the most common type of hernia in women?
    
    Indirect inguinal hernias
    
    ---
    
    While femoral hernias are more common in women, indirect inguinal is more common
    
- 🍒How do you differentiate between an irreducible femoral and an irreducible inguinal hernia on physical exam?
    
    The neck of a femoral hernia always lies below and lateral to the pubic tubercle, whereas the sac of an indirect inguinal hernia extends above and medial to this landmark
    
    ![[Untitled 11 7.png|Untitled 11 7.png]]
    
- 🍒Femoral hernias have a relatively `higher` rate of strangulation
    
    Due to their narrow neck. Hence for those presenting electively, these should be fixed ideally within 2 weeks of presentation.
    
- 🍒What are the three different surgical approaches for elective repair of a femoral hernia?
    - Low approach (Lockwood): incision below the inguinal ligament → no interference with inguinal structures but limited space for access or removal of small bowel
    - High approach (McEvedy): incision above the inguinal ligament → access to intraperitoneal space (preferred in emergency because easy access for small bowel resection)
    - Inguinal approach (Lotheissen): incision in external oblique aponeurosis → access to intraperitoneal space via trasversalis fascia
- 🍒What are three notable differentials for lump in the groin other than inguinal and femoral hernias?
    
    - Saphena varix
    - Femoral artery aneurysm
    - Atheletic pubalgia

# Richter’s hernia
- 🍒In what kind of common hernia is a Richter hernia particularly likely to occur in?
    
    Femoral hernia
    
- 🍒What is a richter’s hernia?
    
    Hernia where only part of the wall of the small intestine herniates through the defect, where it is then strangulated. Because the lumen is not blocked symptoms of intestinal obstruction do not occur

# Congenital Umbilical Hernia
- 🍒What is the management of congenital umbilical hernia in a child
    
    The vast majority close spontaneously during the first year of life. Surgical repair is indicated if the hernia persists after 2 years old
