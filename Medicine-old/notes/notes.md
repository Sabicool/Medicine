- Explanation for the procedure for MSU to patients
    1. Don't need to wash genitalia
    2. Start voiding (part labia) and then catch it
    3. Fill about half
    4. Wash the outside
    5. Put in fridge
    6. Put in bag and give it to counter

    > Arterial blood gas analysis is used to determine the adequacy of oxygenation and ventilation, assess respiratory function and determine the acid-base balance.

    - United Kingdom defines miscarriage as up to 24 weeks’ gestation, although note that a small number of babies do now survive when born before 24 weeks
    - Australia and New Zealand use **==20 weeks or 400 g==** if the gestation is not known
    - World Health Organization (WHO) has recommended that a fetus be considered potentially viable when the gestation period has reached 22 weeks or more, or when the fetus weighs 500 g or more

- Miscarriage
    
    - Most miscarriages occur naturally between the **==6th and 10th weeks==** of pregnancy
    - A previous stillbirth, but not a neonatal death, and a previous miscarriage also increase the likelihood of a miscarriage
    - Miscarriage is mose common cause of bleeding in early pregnancy (95%) but other causes to be excluded: ectopic gestation, cervical bleeding, endocervical polyp, hydatiform mole
    
    - Aetiology
        - Implanatation (20%)
        - Foetal factors (70%) (0-10 weeks)
            - 40% of these cases have chromosomal anomalies
        - Maternal factors (10%) (11-22 weeks)
            - 2% ⇒ Systemic maternal diseases (e.g. SLE, diabetes) + maternal infections
            - 8% ⇒ Uterine abnormalities (fibroids, submucosal tumours or cervical incompetence)
    - Types of miscarriage
        
        ![[Untitled 3.png]]
        
        - Threatened miscarriage
            - Bleeding (w/ w/o painful contractions)
            - Cervix not dilated + normal sized amniotic sac w/ foetus whose heart is beating
            - Management: reassurance
        - Inevitable miscarriage
            - PV bleeding + strong uterine contractions + dilatation of the cervix
            - Treatment:
                - Remove POC protruding from cervix on examination
                    - Remove with finger or sponge (leaving in → vasovagal shock)
                - 0.5 mg **ergometrine** if bleeding heavily or 0.25 mg **ergometrine** if in shock
                - U/S to assess complete or incomplete
                - If incomplete
                    
                    - Suction curettage ==**(NOT D&C → uterus is floppy → Asherman Syndrome)**== followed by administration of 0.25 mg IV ergometrine
                    
                    OR
                    
                    - Administer **misoprotol** 400 μg 4-hourly for three doses or 800 μg as a single dose (achieves evacuation in 60-80% of cases)
                - Tissue removed should be sent for histopathology (evaluate for choriocarcinoma)
                - Rhesus negative → Kleihauer-Betke test (assess amount of feotal blood cells in maternal circulation) + **prophylactic injection of 250 IU Rh D immunoglobulin**
            - Follow up
                - Bleeding and pain > 10 days → placental left in uterus
                - Rx: **U/S** → retained POC + **suction curretage**
        - Septic miscarriage
            - Organisms usually endogenous: anaerobic streptococci, stahylococci or Escherichia coli
            - Clinical features
                - If infection in decidua → **malodorous, pink vaginal discharge** ± pyrexia
                - Tachycardia ⇒ spread beyond the uterus
                - Vaginal examination → boggy, tender uterus w/ evidence of extra-uterine spread
            - Ix
                - High vaginal swab
                - Septicaemia → blood cultures
                - Severe infections → U/C + coagulation studies
            - Rx
                - Broad-acting antibiotics
            - Septic shock
                - Follows 5% of miscarriages
                - Clinical features: pyrexi (or hypothermia), rigors, hypotension, tachycardia and hypoventilation
                - Refer to ICU
        - Missed miscarriage/abortion
            - Rx
                - No medical need to treat missed miscarriage urgently as most cases end in spontaneous miscarraige
                - Information and support
                - Early evacuation of the uterus
                    - Surgical (<12/14 wks)
                    - Medical: mifepristone, misoprotol or prostaglandins
    - Recurrent miscarriage
        - A woman who has three or more successive miscarriages is termed a recurrent miscarrier
        - Ix
            - TVUS → submucosal fibroid, uterine septa, cervical incompetence, PCOS
            - Blood test:
                - PCOS (FSH:LH)
                - Antiphospholipid syndrome (antibodies) → Rx w/ low-dose aspirin and heparin
                - Thrombophilias → Rx heparin therapy in 2nd trimester (not in 1st)
        - Cervical incompetence

- Antepartum haemorrhage
    
    - Antepartum haemorrhage is defined as significant bleeding from the birth canal occurring ==**after the 20th week**== of pregnancy
    
    - Placenta praevia
        - First episode of significant bleeding is usually not heavy
        - The woman should be admitted to the hospital, & if placenta praevia is suspected, ==**no vaginal examination made**==, as this may start torrential bleeding
        - U/S to confirm the diagnosis
