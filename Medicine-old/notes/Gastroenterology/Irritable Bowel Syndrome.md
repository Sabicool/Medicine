- Classification
    - IBS-C (IBS w/ predominant constipation: Bristol stool 1 and 2)
    - IBS-D (IBS w/ predominant diarrhoea: Bristol stool 6 and 7)
    - IBS-M (IBS w/ mixed bowel habits)
    - IBS unclassified
- History
    - Risk factors: female, age <50, previous enteric infection, PTSD Hx of physical or sexual abuse & family history
    - Abdominal pain (esp. associated with alteration of bowel habits)
    - Abdominal pain (not associated w/ N&V) + improved w/ ==**defecation and passage of flatus**==
- Investigations> [!important]  
    > 1st Most important test: FBCShould be normal â†’ anaemia or â†‘ WBC suggests non IBS disease  
      
    > [!important]  
    > At first presentation check FBC, coeliac serology and CRP for diarrhoea predominant IBS  
    
    Consider:
    
    - Faecal occult blood test
    - Coeliac disease (anti-tTG or igA endomysial) antibody
    - Faecal calprotectin â†’ <50mcg/g â‡’ IBD unlikely
    - CRP
    - Colonoscopy if alarm symptoms:
        - Haematochezia, melaena, unintentional weight loss, older age of onset (>50), family hx for colon cancer or IBD
    
    - Clinical features that warrant further Ix. of GI Sx

- Diagnostic Criteria
    
    - Rome IV criteria
        
        Recurrent abdominal pain, on average at least 1 day/week in the last 3 months w/ association with â‰¥2 of the following:
        
        - Related to defecation
        - Associated with a change in frequency of stool
        - Associated with a change in form (appearance) of stool
    
    - Manning criteria
        
        Recurrent abdominal pain and â‰¥2 of the following:
        
        - Relief of pain w/ defecation
        - More frequent stools at the onset of pain
        - Looser stools at the onset of pain
        - Visible abdominal distention
        - Passage of mucous per rectum
        - A sensation of incomplete evacuation
- Management
    - Low FODMAP diet
        - Most evidence-based diet for treating IBS
    - Neuromodulation
        - There is evidence that use of a neuromodulator can improve abdominal pain, and appears to provide global symptom relief for functional gastrointestinal disorders
        - TCAs should be tried first
            
            ![[Untitled 1 30.png|Untitled 1 30.png]]
            
    - Constipation predominant IBS
        - Soluble fibre
    - Also consider psychiatric and psychological assessment
        - Consider depression, anxiety and mental health disorders following past emotional or sexual trauma
