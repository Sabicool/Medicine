See osce notes: [[GORD Management]]
Think of it as a spectrum from gastro-esophageal reflux → gastro-esophageal reflux _disease_
> [!important]  
> Severity of symptoms is not a reliable indicator of the severity of disease  

## Diagnosis and Investigations
- 🍒gord is considerd to be present if:
	- symptoms occur ≥2 times per week
	- impact quality of life significantly
	- complications are present (oesophageal ulceration and sequelae or extra-oesophageal symptoms)
- 🍒is endoscopy useful for diagnosis of gord?
	- approximately two-thirds of all people with reflux symptoms have no evidence of macroscopic inflammation on upper gastrointestinal endoscopy
	- endoscopy is not routinely recommended for patients who have typical symptoms of gastro-oesophageal reflux (heartburn or regurgitation) that respond to treatment. endoscopic findings must be interpreted in the context of any acid suppression therapy the patient is taking.
- 🍒what are the indications for endoscopy in patients with suspected gord
	- alarm symptoms:
		- anaemia
		- dysphagia
		- haematemesis or melaena
		- vomiting
		- weight loss
	- new symptoms in an older person
	- changing symptoms
	- severe or frequent symptoms
	- inadequate response to treatment
	- atypical symptoms
##  Management
- gastro-oesophageal reflux
	- mild intermittent symptoms (1 or 2 episodes per week)
		- diet and lifestyle modifications might be sufficient to control symptoms
			- diet: reflux symptoms are commonly induced by high-fat meals, alcohol, coffee, chocolate, citrus fruit, tomato products, spicy foods and carbonated beverages
				- limiting specific foods may improve symptoms, but this should only be continued if effective; advise patients to avoid food restrictions that do not improve symptoms
			- weight loss can be effective for improving reflux symptoms in patients who are overweight; even modest weight loss can be beneficial
			- smaller meals
			- eat slowly
			- avoiding lying down after eating
			- avoiding eating or drinking for 2 to 3 hours before bedtime
			- positional therapy device (e.g. wedge pillow) or elevating the head of the bed
			- stopping smoking
		- if symptoms are sufficiently troublesome; on-demand antacid therapy:
			- 🍒what is the management of mild intermittent gastrointestinal reflux
				**stepwise management:**
				- antacids (e.g. magnesium hydroxide, aluminium hydroxide) prn
				- h2-receptor antagonist therapy once or twice daily if symptoms persist (e.g. famotidine, nizatidine)
				- ppi (esomeprazole, lansoprazole, pantoprazole etc), once daily, half to one hour before a meal
				- advise patients to return for review if symptoms persist
				- ppi therapy for gastro-oesophageal reflux is more effective when taken half to one hour before a meal. the effectiveness of ppi therapy is reduced if taken with or after a meal.
- gastro-oesophageal reflux disease
	- proton pump inhibitors (ppis) are generally preferred to h2-receptor antagonists for initial therapy of gord because they are more effective at standard doses.
	- 🍒what is the management for gastrointestinal reflux disease
		if no alarm symptoms:
		- stepdown management with trial of standard dose ppi (e.g. esompreazole, omeprazole, pantoprazole) for 4-8 weeks
		- if effective step down to the lowest dose and frequency that controls symptoms or stop altogether
	- 🍒how should patients time when they take their ppi in the management of gord
		- before breakfast if symptoms in daytime
		- before evening meal if symptoms occur in evening
	- 🍒what is the management for gastrointestinal reflux disease with extra-oesophageal symptoms
		- stepdown management with trial of high dose ppi therapy for 8-12 weeks
# Other Notes
risk of ulcers and h. pylori
- nsaids
- nocturnal cough
- sleep disturbance
- frequency of symptoms (>2-3/day) → gord therapy
- blood
urea breath test → if positive then endoscopy → antibiotics np7
lifestyle
- weight reduction
- waiting before meals and sleeping
- smaller meals
- spicy and fatty decrease
- 4-5 coffees/day
- better sleep
    - nocturnal cough can be improved by elevating head with pillow
gord therapy
- 4-8 weeks of standard ppi dose
- 4 weeks see how they're tra
- 4 weeks review → taper to 0 (PPIs cannot be used for >8 weeks)
Surgical
- Fundiplication
