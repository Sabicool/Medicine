- Includes:
    - Alanine transaminase (ALT)
    - Aspartate aminotransferase (AST)
    - Alkaline phosphatase (ALP)
    - Gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT)
    - Bilirubin
    - Albumin

- ALT/AST
    - üçíRaised ALT/AST levels in the blood occur in `heaptocellular injury`
        Examples include:
        - Hepatitis (viral, alcoholic, ischaemic)
        - [[Liver cirrhosis]]
        - Drug/toxin-induced liver injury (e.g. [[Paracetamol overdose]])
        - [Hepatocellular carcinoma](https://www.notion.so/Hepatocellular-carcinoma-3e329e5edb7f43c392cb25aee9a4d372?pvs=21)
    - üçíAn AST:ALT ratio greater than `2:1` is classical of [[Alcoholic liver disease]]
    - üçíWhat are the expected changes in LFTs in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease
		- Typically in NAFLD, ALT and AST have a two or three-fold elevation, with AST/ ALT ratio <1
	 - üçíA greater than 10-fold increase in ALT and a less than 3-fold increase in ALP suggests a predominantly `hepatocellular injury`
    - üçíA less than 10-fold increase in ALT and a more than 3-fold increase in ALP suggests `cholestasis`
    - üçíHepatocellular injury is suggested by what changes in ALT and ALP
        - A >10x increase in ALT and a <3x increase in ALP
    - üçíCholestasis is suggested by what changes in ALT and ALP
         - A <10x increase in ALT and a >3x increase in ALP

 - ALP/GGT
    - ALP is derived from biliary epithelial cells and bones ‚áí marker of cholestasis or bone disease
    - GGT is found in hepatocytes and also biliary epithelial cells
    - Raised ALP with normal GGT ‚áí bone disease (e.g. Paget‚Äôs disease, vitamin D deficiency, bony metastases)
    - Raised ALP and GGT ‚áí cholestasis
    - Isolated raised GGT ‚áí alcohol excess
- Bilirubin
    - Waste product of haemoglobin breakdown
    - Can be used as a marker of severity in an acute cholestatic pathology
    - Metabolised and excreted by liver
    - Raised bilirubin causes jaundice
    - Raised levels of bilirubin in the blood can be caused by:
        - Excess bilirubin production (**pre-hepatic jaundice**) ‚áí e.g. haemolysis ‚áí raised bilirubin with normal LFTs
        - A breakdown in bilirubin metabolism (**hepatocellular jaundice**)
        - A blockage in the bile excretion pathway (**cholestatic jaundice**)
- Albumin
    - A non-specific marker of synthetic function
    - A fall in albumin can be due to:
        - Decreased production: malnutrition, severe liver disease
        - Increased albumin loss: protein losing enteropathies, nephrotic syndrome
    - Albumin has a half-life of 20 days, so it will take time to decrease, even in severe liver disease.
        - Further assessment of the synthetic function of the liver can be gained by ordering a coagulation screen, as the liver is also responsible for the synthesis of clotting factors. ‚áí increased PT and INR
