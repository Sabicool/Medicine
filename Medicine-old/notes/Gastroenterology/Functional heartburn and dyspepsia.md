- Functional heartburn should be suspected in patients with heartburn that persists despite PPI therapy
- If acid suppression insufficient ‚Üí trial of neuromodulator therapy (low-dose [[notes/Pharmacology/Antidepressants/Tricyclic Antidepressants (TCAs)|Tricyclic Antidepressants (TCAs)]] or [[notes/Pharmacology/Antidepressants/Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs)|Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs)]])
