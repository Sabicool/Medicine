Polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR) is a common inflammatory rheumatic disease that mainly affects patients above the age of 50 years and occurs twice as often in women than in men. Patients typically present with new-onset pain in their shoulders, hips, or neck, morning stiffness, and systemic symptoms (e.g., fatigue, malaise, B symptoms, and depressed mood). In addition to clinical presentation, the diagnosis is made based on laboratory studies, which usually show a highly elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), while creatine kinase and autoantibodies are negative.

    Check ESR and CRP monthly for the first 3 months of therapy, then every 2 to 3 months thereafter or as clinically indicated
