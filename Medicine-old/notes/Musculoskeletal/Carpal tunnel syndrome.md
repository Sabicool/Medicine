# Symptoms
- Entrapment of the median nerve in the carpal tunnel at the wrist
- Presents with paraesthesia, pain and numbness in the fingers and thumb in the distribution of the median nerve
	- Generally nocturnal and dysaesthetic
	- ![[images/Carpal tunnel syndrome.png]]
	- ![[images/Carpal tunnel syndrome-1.png]]
- Usually, there is no loss of sensation of the palmar surface of the thenar eminence because it is innervated by the superficial branch of the median nerve, which arises 5–7 cm proximal to the carpal tunnel and is, therefore, not compressed
	- Hence decreased sensation over the thenar eminence suggests median nerve involvement proximal to the carpal tunnel
- Examination of motor system: may show weakness in thumb abduction and opposition as well as thenar atrophy
# Aetiology and Risk Factors
- Common in middle aged women and pregnant women
- Generally idiopathic but can be associated with [[notes/Endocrinology/Diabetes Mellitus Type 2|Diabetes]], [[notes/Endocrinology/Hypothyroidism|Hypothyroidism]], [[notes/Musculoskeletal/Rheumatoid arthritis|Rheumatoid arthritis]], [[Complications of Pregnancy|Pregnancy]] and overuse
	- If associated with pregnancy ⇒ resolves within 4 weeks of delivery
- Resolves spontaneously in up to 1/3 of patients
- Risk factors:
	- Previous fracture of wrist
	- Manual work with repetitive flexion/extension
	- Rheumatoid arthritis
	- Pregnancy
	- Obesity
	- Osteoarthritis
	- Systemic amyloidosis
	- Renal failure
	- Diabetes mellitus
	- Hypothyroidism
# Diagnosis
- Can often be diagnosed clinically (see: [[notes/OSCE Prep/Wrist Examination|Wrist Examination]])
- Nerve conduction studies can be used to confirm diagnosis and test the function of the nerve
	- Helps differentiate it from C6 radiculopathy
# Management
- Treatment of the underlying medical condition if present
- Non pharmacological management
	- Splinting and hand braces may provide short-term symptomatic relief
	- Elevating the forearm on a pillow at night
		- Also hanging the hand over the side of the bed and shaking or rubbing it (Murtagh, 2012)
	- Exercise or mobilisation has insufficient evidence
	- Warmth seems to aggravate the pain (Murtagh, 2012)
- 1st line management
	- NSAID may provide pain relief (avoid in late pregnancy >32 weeks gestation)[^1]
- 2nd line management
	- Injection of corticosteroid into the carpal tunnel (especially for [[notes/Musculoskeletal/Rheumatoid arthritis|Rheumatoid arthritis]])
- Surgical management can be offered for patients who do not respond to conservative measures, if progressive sensory or motor deficits or if there is moderate to severe electrodiagnostic abnormalities
	- Operation is mostly successful
	- Operation relieves pressure on the nerve by cutting through carpal tunnel so that more space is created for the median nerve
- Do not use diuretics for carpal tunnel syndrome

# Footnotes
[^1]: As per eTG. Amboss however says NSAID is not effective in managing CTS. Instead Amboss recommends splinting and glucocorticoid injection and assess after 6 weeks.
