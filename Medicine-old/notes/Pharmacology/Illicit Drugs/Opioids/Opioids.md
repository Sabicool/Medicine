> [!important]  
> Opioids are the most common cause of drug-related death in Australia. More likely to cause death in children and other opioid-naive people. First-line treatment is support of airway and breathing  
- Mechanism of action
    - Activate opioid receptors (mu, kappa and delta)
- Types
    - Prototype: Morphine
    - Hydromorphone, meridine, fentanyl, codeine
    - Drug of abuse: heroin (diamorphine)
- Heroin use
    - IVDU
        Contaminated needles or drugs can lead to:
        - Bacteremia â†’ Tricuspid [[Infective Endocarditis]]
        - [[Viral hepatitits]] B & C
        - [[HIV-AIDS]]
    - Clinical features
        - Pain relief
        - Euphoria
        - Sedation
        - Slurred speech
        - Respiratory depression
        - Cough suppression
        - Miosis (small pupils)
            - Exception: meperidine
        - Constipation
        - Nausea
        - Vomiting
        - Skin warmth and flushing
    - Addiction and tolerance
        - Highly addictive
        - Tolerance develops
            - No tolerance to **miosis** and **constipation**
    - Risk factors for toxicity
        - High potency opioids (e.g. carfentanil)
        - Longer duration of action
            - Long-acting opioids such as bruprenorphine, fentanyl analogues and methadone
            - Opioids available as modified-release preparations such as hydromorphone, morphone, oxycodone, tramadol and tampentadol
        - Opioid naivety
        For loperamide in particular, concurrent use of CYP28 and and P-glycoprotein inhibitors
    - Investigations
        - Serum creatinine concentration
    - Acute presentation
        - Clinical features
            - Central nervous system effects
                - CNS depression: ranging from drowsiness to coma
                - [[Serotonergic toxidrome]]
                - Seizures
                    - Most common with tramadol, tapentadol or meperidine
            - Euphoria to depressed mental status
            - Cardiovascular effects
                - QRS widening, atrioventricular nodal block and tachyarrhythmias with detropropoxyphene
            - Decreased respiratory drive
                - Reduced minute volume, reduced respiratory rate or apnoea
            - Decreased bowel sounds
            - Miotic (constricted) pupils
                - Boards said that all patients will have it (including opioid tolerant patients)
                - eTG says not present in all patients and not specific for opioid drug poisonings
        - Investigations
            - Blood gas analysis
        - Management> [!important]  
            > In the community or primary healthcare setting, treat patients with suspected opioid poisoning with airway and breathing support, and naloxone  
            - Naloxone
                - Short-acting opioid antagonist â†’ reverses hypoventilation and increase patientâ€™s level of consciousness to protect their airway
                    ![[Pasted image 20240109173753.png]]
                    - If toxicity not adequately reversed after a total bolus dose of 10 mg of naloxone or if toxicity occurs use a naloxone infusion> [!important]  
                        > Infusion is more likely required in:Ingestion of long-acting opioids (e.g. mathadone, some fentanyl analogues)Ingested modified-release opioid preparations (e.g. morphine, oxycodone)Impaired renal excretion of active opioid metabolites  
                        ![[Pasted image 20240109173825.png]]
                - Community
                    In the community, patients who are hypo-ventilating can be given naloxone IM or as a nasal spray
                    ![[Pasted image 20240109173846.png]]

                > Iatrogenic Opioid WithdrawalMay cause withdrawal if dose is too highCaused by opiod antagonistPotentially life-threateningSurges in catecholaminesHamodynamic instabilityUse the clinically oriented withdrawal scale (COWS) to assess withdrawal  
                
            
            - Seizures
                - Seizures do not generally require treatment as they are self-limiting
                - If persistent or recurrent use IV benzodiazepines
        - Discharge and Disposition
            
            - For patients with an opioid ingestion, observe them for a minimum of:
                - 12 hours for poisoning due to an immediate-release preparation
                - 24 hours for poisoning due to a long-acting or modified-release preparation
                - 16 hours for poisoning due to ==tramadol because of the high risk of delayed seizures==
            - For patients who have received naloxone, only discharge them if they have no evidence of respiratory depression, they have a normal level of consciousness, and it is at least:
                - 2 hours after a single bolus dose of intravenous naloxone
                - 4 hours after a single bolus dose of intramuscular or intranasal naloxone
                - 4 hours after a naloxone infusion has been ceased
            
            - Only discharge patients in daylight hours
            - Advise patients not to drive or operate machinery for at least 3 days after discharge
    - Naturally Occurring Opioid Withdrawal> [!important]  
        > People who use heroin initially seek the euphoric and emotional numbing effects, but once dependent will also be motivated by avoidance of withdrawal  
        
        - Starts 6-12 hours after the last dose, peaks at around day 2 to day 3 and are resolved after day 5 to day 7
        
        - Clinical features
            
            Reversal of CNS, eye, skin and GI effects
            
            - Not life-threatening
            - Agitation

            - Goose bumps (piloerection)
            - Yawning
            - Rhinorrhoea
            - Lacrimation
            
            > [!important]  
            > Common exam question. Typical symptoms are yawning, rhinorrhoea, lacrimation and piloerection  
            
        - Management
            - Buprenorphine is the mainstay of treatment and the dose and duration should be titrated according to withdrawal severity
                ![[Pasted image 20240109173930.png]]
            - Anxiety and agitation can be treated with benzodiazepines
                ![[Pasted image 20240109173943.png]]
                > [!important]  
                > Prescribing benzodiazepines in outpatient settingUse in combination with heroin increases the risk of fatal overdoseIf they are necessary, it can be collected daily and administration supervised  
                
    - Opioid Dependence
        
        - Psyhosocial interventions
        - Methadone (full agonist)
            - Long-acting oral opiate
            - Reduces cravings
            - Maintenance
            - Causes QTc interval prolongation (might not be serious)
        - Buprenorphine
            - Partial agonist (agonist and antagonist)
                - Low risk of overdose and physical dependence compared to methadone
                - Has a high affinity for opioid receptors â†’ reversal of buprenorphine overdose with naloxone requires higher doses
            - Long duration of action
            - Sublingual tablet
            - Combined with naloxone
                - Prevents abuse
                    - If crushed â†’ IV injection â†’ no effect
                - Naloxone not absorbed sublingually
        - Naltrexone
            - Only small proportion of patients are compliant
            - Long acting opioid antagonist
        
        - Clonidine is not used anymore as readily
            - Clonidine
                - Central alpha agonist
