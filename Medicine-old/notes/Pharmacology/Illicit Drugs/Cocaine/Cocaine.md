> [!important]  
> If cocaine is taken with alcohol, a unique cocaine metabolite, cocaethylene, is produced. This has similar effects to cocaine but a prolonged duration of action.  
- Mechanism of action
    
    Has 2 effects:
    
    1. Inhibits monoamine reuptake
        
		![[Pasted image 20240109172725.png]]
        
        - Blocks reuptake of monamines (e.g. norepinephrine) and in doing so increase the levels of the monoamine in the synaptic cleft
        - [[Traditional amphetamines and synthetic cathinone]] additionally increase the release of monoamines into the synaptic cleft
    
    1. Local anaesthetic (sodium channel blocker)
- Clinical presentation
    - Presents as a sympathomimetic toxidrome (see [[Assessment of stimulant drug poisoning]])
    - Common symptoms for cocaine _specifically_ include:
        - Headache
        - Chest pain
- Key investigations
    - U&E
    - Creatine kinase
    - ECG
    - Troponin
    - Chest X-ray
    - Consider:
        - Neuroimaging if stroke or intracranial haemorrhage is suspected
        - CT aortography if aortic dissection is suspected
- Management
    - Airway, sedation, hyperthermia, hypertension as per [[Assessment of stimulant drug poisoning]]
    - Chest pain
        - As per [[Acute Coronary Syndromes]]
        - Chest pain that does not respond to IV benzodiazepines â‡’ glyceryl trinitrate
        
        > [!important]  
        > Beta blockers are contraindicated. Calcium channel blockers used if other therapies failed  
        - Pathophysiology
            - Due to mismatch between decreased oxygen supply (coronary vasoconstriction) and increased oxygen demand (tachycardia and elevated BP)
            - Avoid beta-blockers because it increases the alpha effects â‡’ worsening of hypertension and chest pain
    - Arrhythmias> [!important]  
        > Amiodarone is not recommended for ventricular tachycardia  
          
        > [!important]  
        > QRS WideningIf QRS widening is associated with airway, breathing or circulatory compromise (eg arrhythmias, hypotension), or CNS depression, immediately start serum alkalinisation (intravenous sodium bicarbonate) and hyperventilation therapy (by intubation and mechanical ventilation)
        > This will cause hypokalaemia â‡’ monitor potassium concentration and replace if required

        > [!important]  
        > QT-interval prolongationCorrect magnesium deficiency rapidly. If potassium concentration <5 mmol/L give potassium (oral or IV) and target for high normal (i.e. 5-5.5 mmol/L)
        > If hypocalcaemia give calcium gluconate

        > [!important]  
        > Torsades de pointesDrug inducedFirst line management for drug-induced torsades de pointes is magnesium sulfate. If the patientâ€™s heart rate <90 bpm give IV bolus of isoprenaline to assess heart rate response and switch to infusion when practical

    - Seizures
        - Seizures are managed with larger doses of IV benzodiazepines
            - Anticonvulsants are often ineffective
    - Observation and Disposition> [!important]  
        > Patients can be safely discharged after â‰¥4 hours of observation if:Symptoms have resolved spontaneously or following treatment with benzodiazepinesHave no signs of end-organ damage  
        
- Withdrawal
    
    Chronic heavy users who stop taking cocaine; usually not life-threatening
    
    - Depression and anhedonia
    - Anxiety
    - Cravings
    - Increased sleep
