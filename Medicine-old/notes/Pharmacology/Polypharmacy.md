- üçíStudies show that the risk of medication-related harm rises once the number of regularly prescribed medicines exceeds `five`
    
    This risk increases exponentially as the number reaches eight or more
    
    Medicines that deserve particular attention are [[Benzodiazepines]] and other sedative-hypnotics, [[Anti-Psychotics]], [[Antihyperglycaemics (Diabetic Medications)]], antithrombotic agents (e.g. [[Anti-platelets]] and [[Anticoagulants]]), [[Antihypertensives]], and anti-anginal agents

- Trying to achieve aggressive treatment targets, such as BP <130/80 or HbA1c <7 per cent, in frail older patients with multiple co-morbidities confers little benefit and a higher risk of harm.
