- Myocarditis ‚áí presents with cardiac failure and arrhythmias
    - Monitoring for the development of myocarditis is necessary
- Start treatment only if white cell count and absolute neutrophil count are normal; blood monitoring is required each week for the first 18 weeks and then each month
- üçíWhy is clozapine (and not other anti-psychotics) recommended in the management of psychosis in [[Parkinson‚Äôs disease]]?
    
    Clozapine elicits antipsychotic effects by binding to the D4 receptor, which does not worsen the symptoms of Parkinson disease.
    
    Standard antipsychotic drugs worsen disease severity by binding tot he dopamine D2 receptor
