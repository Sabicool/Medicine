The Bohr effect is a phenomenon first described in 1904 by the Danish physiologist Christian Bohr. Hemoglobin's oxygen binding affinity (see oxygenâ€“haemoglobin dissociation curve) is inversely related both to acidity and to the concentration of carbon dioxide.
Since carbon dioxide reacts with water to form carbonic acid, an increase in $\ce{CO2}$ results in a decrease in blood pH, resulting in haemoglobin proteins releasing their load of oxygen.
