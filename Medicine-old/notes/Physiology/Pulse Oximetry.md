- Probe emits 660 nm (red, for Hb) and 940 nm (infrared for $\ce{O2Hb}$)
- Pulse oximetry will read 85% when not connected to a patient
- Methemoglobin will cause pulse oximetry to approach 85%
	- Causes: prilocaine/benzocaine topicalisation, [[Metoclopramide]], dapsone, nitric oxide, nitroglycerine
	- Treatment: methylene blue, vitamin C (in [[G6PD deficiency]])
- Carboxyhaemoglobin ($\ce{COHb}$) has similar absorbance to $\ce{O2Hb}$ with a higher affinity for Hb than oxygen
	- This means pulse oximetry might be 95% despire fractional oximetry at 50%
	- Causes: smoke inhalation, volatile anaesthetic degradation, dessicated baralyme/soda lime
	- Treatments: 100% FiO2, hyperbaric Oxygen
- Other factors producing a flasely low pulse oximetry
	- dyes (methylene blue > indocyanine green > indigo carmine)
	- blue nail polish
	- shivering/other motion,
	- ambient light
	- malpositioned sensor
	- low perfusion (low cardiac output, profound anemia, hypothermia, elevated SVR)
