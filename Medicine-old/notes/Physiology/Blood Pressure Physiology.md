# Variation with Position
- A change in height of 10 cm correlates with a pressure change of 7.4 mmHg (mnemonic pH: 7.410)
- A change in height of 15 cm correlates with a pressure change of 10 mmHg

# Mean Arterial Pressure
$$
\begin{align*}
\rm MAP&=\frac{SBP + 2DBP}{3}\\
&=\rm DBP + \frac{Pulse\;Pressure}{3}
\end{align*}
$$
# Pulse Pressure
$$
\rm Pulse\;Pressure=Systolic\;Pressure-Diastolic\;Pressure
$$
- Increases with stroke volume
	- In spontaneously breathing patients, pulse pressure ==decreases== with inspiration
- Decreases with vessel wall compliance
