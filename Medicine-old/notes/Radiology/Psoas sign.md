- 🍒What is the psoas sign and what does it represent?
    It is when the lateral edge of the psoas muscle(s) is no longer clearly demarcated. Only a portion of the muscle edge needs to be obscured for the sign to be considered positive.
    It can be a sign of oedema in the psoas muscle due to retroperitoneal pathology.
Normal radiographs with psoas muscle apparent:
