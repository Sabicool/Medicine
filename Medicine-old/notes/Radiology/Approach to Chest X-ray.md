I decide to use the ABCDEFGHI as this is what I was taught during my surgical rotation (it also makes me remember a lot more stuff and makes more sense (e.g. what should I look for in disability???))
- Approach for chest X-ray
    1. Assess image quality (RIPE):
        - Rotation:
            - Medial aspect of each clavicle should be equidistant from spinous process
            - Spinous processes should also be vertically orientated against the vertebral bodies
        - Inspiration:
            - 5-6 anterior ribs, lung apices, both costophrenic angles and the lateral rib edges should be visible
        - Projection:
            - Note if AP or PA (assume PA if no label)
            - If scapulae are projected ‚Üí AP
        - Exposure
            - Left hemidiaphragm should be visible to the spine and the vertebrae should be visible behind the heart
    2. Lines and tubes:
        - Review lines and tubes (endotracheal tubes, nasogastric tubes, central venous catheters)
    3. Airway:
        - Start at top ‚Üí find trachea in midline ‚Üí trace down to carina ‚Üí trace right main bronchus ‚Üí return to carina and trace left main bronchus
        - Angle between left and right main bronchus should be between 50¬∞ and 100¬∞
    4. Bones and soft tissues:
        - Scan the bones for symmetry, fractures, osteoporosis and lesions
            - Trace each rib posterior to anterior
            - Check clavicles
            - Check proximal humeri
            - Check scapula
            - Look at each vertebral body
        - Evaluate the soft tissues for foreign bodies, swelling and subcutaneous air
            - In females always assess breast tissue (e.g. mastectomy)
    5. Cardiomediastinum:
        - Assess position of heart and direction of apex
        - Assess heart size (PA projection: <50%, AP projection: <60% of chest diameter)
        - Aortic knucle should be present on the left
        - Upper mediastinal contour
        - Pulmonary vessels
    6. Diaphragm:
        - Hemidiaphragms in normal position (right slightly higher than left due to liver)
        - Consider shape (may be flattened bilaterally in chronic [[Asthma]] or [[Emphysema]] or unilaterally in tension [[Pneumothorax]] or foreign body aspiration)
        - ‚ùóLook under the diaphragm for free gas
    7. Effusions:
        - Look for any obvious pleural effusions
        - Costophrenic angle blunting
        - Check lateral film for posterior effusion
    8. Fields, fissures and foreign bodies:
        - Check for symmetry (allowing for mediastinum)
        - Check each zone (apices, upper, middle and lower zones)
            - Lung infiltrates (interstitial and alveolar), masses, consolidation, [[Air Bronchogram]]s, [[Pneumothorax]]
        - Hyperinflation ‚áí >6 anterior or 10 posterior ribs above the level of the dipahragm in the middle clavicular line
        - Check around the lungs:
            - Apex and trace down the edges of the lungs
        - Evaluate major and minor fissures for thickening, fluid or change in position
        - Check position of foreign bodies (e.g. endotracheal tube, NGT, pacemaker leads, central venous lines etc.)
    9. Gastric bubble/great vessels
        - Check aortic size and shape and the outlines of the pulmonary vessels
        - Gastric bubble should be seen clearly and not displaced
    10. Hila and mediastinum
        - Evaluate the hila for lymphadenopathy, calcifications and masses
        - Left hilum usually higher than the right
        - Check for widening of the mediastinum
        - Check for tracheal deviation
        - Check for presence of thymus in children
    11. Impression

Have to do multiple cards for this, ain‚Äôt no way I‚Äôm spending 20 minutes on doing this one card

# Additional Notes
- Left atrial enlargement showing various good signs for analysis (radiopaedica case: [https://radiopaedia.org/cases/20314/studies/20233?lang=gb](https://radiopaedia.org/cases/20314/studies/20233?lang=gb))
	   ![[Pasted image 20240109162904.png]] ![[Pasted image 20240109162922.png]]
     - Although the entire heart is enlarged, a double contour is seen through the right side of the heart. The more medial line is the enlarged left atrium (white dotted line) and the heart border is more lateral (blue dotted line)
     ![[Pasted image 20240109162950.png]]
     - The size of the left atrium (blue arrow) measured from the mid point of the left main bronchus (yellow dotted line) to the mid point of the double density line (white dotted line) is clearly more than 7cm
    ![[Pasted image 20240109163021.png]]
     - The subcarinal angle (yellow solid line) is also enlarged, much more than the upper limit of normal taken to be 90-100 degrees
- Extensive free gas under the diaphragm. Good image to show variety of air bubbles that might present on CXR
    ![[Pasted image 20240109163037.png]]
    ![[Pasted image 20240109163056.png]]
     - A large amount of gas is seen under both diaphragmatic domes (yellow dotted lines). In the left upper quadrant gas is also seen in the stomach (red dotted line) and splenic flexure of the colon (blue dotted line).
- Flattened diaphragm in [[Emphysema]]
