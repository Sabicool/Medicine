Also see [[Pharyngitis]]
- Infectious-contagious bacterialÂ illness that often presents as diffuse erythematous rash in the setting of a sore throat (streptococcal pharyngitis) or school sores (impetigo) in children under 10 years of age
- Caused by Group AÂ beta-haemolytic streptococciÂ (GABHS),Â primarilyÂ _Streptococcus pyogenes_, integrated with aÂ bacteriophage producing a specific type of erythrogenic toxin
- Clinical features
    - **Pharyngitis**: tonsillopharyngeal erythema, exudates, and petechial macules of palate (strep throat)
    - **Rash**: appears 24-48 hours after the start of the fever; usually starts on the neck, chest, axilla and groin before spreading to the rest of the body over 24 hours
        
        - Blanches on pressure
        - After the rash fades, the skin desquamates (especially over the hands, feet, toes and fingers) after 7-10 days of resolution and may last up to 6 weeks
        - The rash should be differentiated from: early [[Viral hepatitits]] , [[Infectious mononucleosis]] , [[Kawasaki disease]] , [[Toxic shock syndrome]] , [[Measles (Rubeola)]] and [[Rubella]] and drug association eruptions such as sulfonamides, penicillin, streptomycin, quinine and atropine (more commonly cause mucosal erosions and crusts)

    - **Filatov mask:** facial flushing with circumoral pallor; persists as pigmented lines following desquamation
        
        - Sandpaper rash does not appear on the face
        
        ![[Untitled 1 51.png|Untitled 1 51.png]]
        
    - **Pastia sign:** pink or red lines produced by confluent petechiae in the skin folds of the upper and lower limbs particularly the creases of the antecubital fossa, axilla and groin
        
        - May appear prior to the appearance of the rash and persist as pigmented lines following desquamation (Pastiaâ€“Grozovici sign; Pastia lines; Thomson sign)

    - **Strawberry tongue:** initially the tongue often has a white coating with red and oedematous papillae projecting through. By day 5, coating peels off, leaving behind a red, glistening tongue studded with prominent papillae (strawberry tongue)

- Diagnosis
    
    Based on the clinical presentation + laboratory results
    
    - Throat and tonsil swab culture or a rapid GABHS antigen detection test
        - S. pyogenes can colonise the throat and positive result does not distinguish between true S. pyogenes pharyngitis/tonsillitis and S. pyogenes carriers with pharyngitis/tonsillitis caused by a viral pathogen (eTG Topic: [Sore Throat](https://tgldcdp-tg-org-au.eu1.proxy.openathens.net/viewTopic?etgAccess=true&guidelinePage=Antibiotic&topicfile=sore-throat&guidelinename=Antibiotic&sectionId=toc_d1e47#toc_d1e47))
    - **Antistreptococcal serologies:** Antistreptolysin O assay or Antideoxyribonuclease B assay
        - Streptococcal serology helps in the diagnosis of post infectious complications which most often occur 2â€“3 weeks after the acute infection, when culture of the causative bacterium is usually no longer possible
- Management
    - The drug of choice for treatment of scarlet fever is penicillin V or penicillin G where compliance an issue (see )
    - In penicillin-allergic patients clarithromycin, azithromycin or clindamycin may be used
