- Superficial fascia
    - Above the umbilics: single sheet of connective tissue continuous with other regions of the body
    - Below the umbilicus: divided into two layers
        - Fatty superficial layer (Camperâ€™s fascia)
        - Membranous deep layer (Scarpiaâ€™s fascia)

- Flat muscles
     - Each flat muscle forms an aponeurosis which covers the vertical rectus abdomininis muscle
    - Linea alba = aponeuroses of all the flat muscles and becomes entwined in the midline
    - External oblique
        - Attachments: originates from ribs 5-12 and inserts onto the iliac crest and pubic tubercle
        - Actions: contralateral rotation of the torso
        - Innervation: Thoracoabdominal nerves and subcostal nerve
    - Internal oblique
        - Attachments: originates from the inguinal ligament, iliac crest and lumbodorsal fascia and inserts onto ribs 10-12
        - Actions: bilateral contraction compresses the abdomen while unilateral contraction ipsilaterally rotates the torso
        - Innervation: Thoracoabdominal nerves, subcostal nerve and branches of the lumbar plexus
    - Transversus abdominis
        - Attachments: Originates from the inguinal ligament, costal cartilages 7-12, the iliac crest and thoracolumbar fascia and inserts onto the conjoint tendon, xiphoid process, linea alba and the pubic crest
        - Actions: Compression of abdominal contents
        - Innervation: Thoracoabdominal nerves, subcostal nerve and branches of the lumbar plexus
