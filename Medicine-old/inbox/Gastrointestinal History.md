# Presenting Complaints
## Abdominal Pain
- Also see [[notes/Surgery/Acute Abdomen Assessment|Acute Abdomen Assessment]]
- Use SOCRATES approach
- Pain may be related to eating, defecation, antacids
- Lying still ⇒ likely peritonitis
- Moving around more ⇒ colicky pain
## Vomiting
- Determine if acute or chronic
- Determine if associated with nausea or comes spontaneously (i.e. w/o warning)
- Determine how long after meals
- Early morning or late in the evening
- Colour? Constituents? Bloodstained, bile-stained or feculent
- Specific vomiting episodes followed by feeling completely well for long periods before the vomiting episodes occur again ⇒ [[Cyclical vomiting syndrome]]
- Loss of weight
- Medications
- ❗ Worsening headaches
## Dysphagia
See [[notes/OSCE Prep/Approach to Dysphagia|Approach to Dysphagia]]
## Diarrhoea
Straight from Talley's:
- How many stools per day do you pass now normally? 
- What do the stools look like (stool form, e.g. loose and watery)? 
- Do you have to run to the bathroom to have a bowel movement? (Urgency in colonic disease) 
- Have you been woken from sleep during the night by diarrhoea? (Organic cause more likely)
- Have you seen any bright-red blood in the stools, or mucus or pus? (Suggests colonic disease) 
- Are you passing large volumes of stool every day? (Suggests small-bowel disease if non-bloody) 
- Are your stools pale, greasy, smelly and difficult to flush away (steatorrhoea)? 
- Have you seen oil droplets in the stool? (Chronic pancreatitis) 
- Have you had problems with leakage of stool (faecal incontinence)? 
- Have you lost weight? (e.g. cancer, malabsorption) 
- Have you had treatment with antibiotics recently? (Consider Clostridium difficile infection) 
- Have you had any recent travel? Where to? (Consider infections such as Giardia) 
- Have you a personal history of inflammatory bowel disease or prior gastrointestinal surgery? 
- Have you any history in the family of coeliac disease or inflammatory bowel disease? 
- Have you had any problems with arthritis? (e.g. inflammatory bowel disease, Whipple’s disease)
