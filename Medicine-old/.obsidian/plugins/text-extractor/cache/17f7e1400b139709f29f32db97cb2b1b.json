The clinician and patient should agree on which day of the week the patient will take their methotrexate and this should be specified on the prescription = folic acid and/or calcium folinate supplementation decreases the risk of adverse effects, including gastrointestinal adverse effects, liver transaminitis and mouth ulcers [NB5]. It should not be taken on the same day as the weekly methotrexate dose = adverse effects can be limited by administering the methotrexate dose at night, splitting the weekly dose over 2 consecutive days (usually 12 hours apart) or administering the dose subcutaneously = |eflunomide and methotrexate have synergistic bone marrow, liver and pulmonary toxicity = at the doses typically used in rheumatology, there is no risk of toxicity to close contacts of patients taking methotrexate and special precautions in handling bodily fluids are not required Ô¨Å","libVersion":"0.2.4","langs":"eng"}
