You will practice a full eye examination on each other with tutor feedback. This session doesn’t include cover/uncover test, eye pressure measurement or slit lamp examination.

Visual acuity • Lighting • Distance - 3m/6m charts o Snellen, Tumbling E for children, adults who can’t communicate verbally, language barriers etc. Animal chart for children • Assessment with glasses • Poor vision – pinhole improves vision of refractive error • Recording visual acuity o Two letters incorrect record as e.g. 6/6 -2, o If three letters – record previous line 6/9 o Very poor vision.  Reduce distance to 3 metres or 1 metre. (record 3/denominator or 1/denominator).  If can’t read at this distance, then count fingers (record as CF@1 metre),  If can’t see, then light perception (record light perception or no light perception) • Near vision o Jaeger chart. Cover one eye read paragraph of small print and repeat. Use reading glasses if use. Perform/demonstrate the skills Colour vision • Lighting • Wear reading glasses if appropriate • Distance 75 cm (30 inches) • Right angle to line of vision • May not need to read all plates • Screens for commonest colour vision: red-green 3 | P a ge Task Perform/demonstrate Visual fields and blind spot Visual fields • Sit apart distance 1 metre • Use hat pin or fingers • Assessor mirrors ‘patient’ – patient covers right eye, assessor coves left. • Ensure equal distance between patient and assessor • Start at periphery and move target slowly to centre, patient to say when first sees the target. Comparison between assessors and patient. • Assess each quadrant Blind spot • Similar technique • Hat pin moved laterally (horizontal) • Patient to assess when red part of hatpin disappears and then when it reappears • Hat pin then moved in vertical direction for superior and inferior borders Perform visual fields – students may be asked to have different defects Eye inspection, pupillary reflexes, eye movements • Eye inspection – including ptosis e,g, Horner’s or oculomotors nerve o Pupil – size, symmetry, shape (congenital, uveitis synechiae, trauma, surgery), colour, corneal haziness, fluid level (hypaema or hypopyon) • Pupillary reflexes o Direct pupillary reflex – light in each eye ipsilateral constriction of each pupil o Consensual papillary reflex – light in right eye and check left eye pupil constriction and vice vera o Swinging light test – for relative afferent pupillary defect o Accommodation reflex – focus on distant object and then to finger (20-30 cm in front of eye) – observe pupil constriction and convergence. • Eye movements o Target (finger or hatpin) 30 cm in front to eyes o Keep head still o Move target through eye axes “H pattern” – nystagmus, extraocular muscle actions Video from 2:27 minutes for demonstration of left afferent defect - https://youtu.be/wpG62cJMJcE Perform tests Lid eversion • Lid eversion for foreign body o Exert down ward traction on the lower lid, get patient to look up and press firmly about half a centimetre below the lid margin 4 | P a ge Task o For upper lid get patient to tilt chin up, to look down with eyes, place cotton tip applicator over eyelid, with your non-dominant hand grasp the eyelashes at the centre of the lid and gently pull down (exposes horizontal skin crease – edge of tarsal plate), with dominant hand place at centre of skin crease and rotate the lid around this ‘fulcrum’ and hold the lid everted with a thumb or finger. Can sweep with a moist cotton tip rolling the cotton tip (not rubbing) Perform Direct opthalmoscopy • Parts of the opthalmoscope (Appendix B) o Beam intensity o Aperture size o Actions of filters • Preparation for fundoscopy o Lighting o Mydriatics (not using) o Patient look straight ahead and fix on a distant target o Right eye assessor for right eye patient and vice versa o Choose smaller less intense light o Correct for self and/or patient o Need to be almost touching (one inch from patient) • Find vessels, follow vessels - move towards the nose - for the optic disc, then move into line of site for the macula (or get patient to look at light) o Assess vessels, AV nipping, copper wiring, look for haemorrhages, cotton wool spots, o Optic nerve – crisp edges, haemorrhages, cup to disc ratio • Test other eye Perform 5 | P a ge APPENDIX A Student ‘patient’ Instructions Visual acuity Snellen chart Tumbling E Animal chart Jaeger near vision chart Colour vision Ishihara Plate instructions https://web.stanford.edu/group/vista/wikiupload/0/0a/Ishihara.14.Plate.Instructions.pdf 6 | P a ge Visual fields 6-8 different instructions 7 | P a ge APPENDIX B. Opthalmoscope Aperture size (beam size) Ophthalmoscopes typically allow you to select from a range of different apertures including: • Micro aperture: used for viewing the fundus through very small undilated pupils • Small aperture: used for viewing the fundus through an undilated pupil • Large aperture: used for viewing the fundus through a dilated pupil and for the general examination of the eye • Slit aperture: can be helpful in assessing contour abnormalities of the cornea, lens and retina as it makes elevation easier to see Filter Filters can be used to highlight specific pathology: • Cobalt blue filter: used to look for corneal abrasions or ulcers with fluorescein dye (see our anterior segment examination guide for more details) • Red-free filter (Green): used to look at the centre of the macula and other vasculature in more detail","libVersion":"0.2.4","langs":""}
