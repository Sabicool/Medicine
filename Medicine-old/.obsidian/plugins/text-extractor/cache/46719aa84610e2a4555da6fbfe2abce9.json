It is rare to feel headache, palpitations or sick until complications set in. What are the risks of having it? Hypertension is often referred to as the ‘silent killer’. You are more likely to have strokes and heart attacks than people with normal BP. The risk increases as the BP rises. ‘With time the pressure can cause the heart and kidneys to wear out, that is heart failure and kidney failure. By keeping the BP within normal limits, we reduce the risks of strokes and heart trouble, including coronary attacks and kidney failure.
