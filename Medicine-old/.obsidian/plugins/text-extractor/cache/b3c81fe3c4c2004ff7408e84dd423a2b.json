These inform an employer that, through your studies, you have acquired discipline knowledge and a range of other skills and capabilities which employers would value in a professional setting. Each unit in your course addresses the Graduate Capabilities through a clearly identified set of learning outcomes. They form a vital part in the process referred to as assurance of learning. The learning outcomes notify you of what you are expected to know, understand or be able to do in order to be successful in this unit. Each assessment for this unit is carefully designed to test your knowledge of one or more of the unit learning outcomes. On successfully completing all of the assessments you will have achieved all of these learning outcomes. Your course has been designed so that on graduating you will have achieved all of Curtin's Graduate Capabilities through the assurance of learning processes in each unit. Curtin's Graduate Capabilities Learning Activities The four themes of the MBBS course continue in this unit: l Theme 1: Scientific Foundations of Medicine l Theme 2: Patient and Doctor: Clinical Practice l Theme 3: Health and Illness in Society l Theme 4: Professional and Personal Development On successful completion of this unit students can: Graduate Capabilities addressed 1 Interpret and apply knowledge of health, illness and end of life care, including aetiology, pathology, clinical features, natural history and prognosis of common conditions and presentations in key medical disciplines (such as medicine and surgery) 2 Communicate clearly, appropriately, professionally, effectively and empathetically with patients and their families/carers, be culturally safe, and involve patients in decision- making 3 Demonstrate competency in clinical skills including history taking, physical examination, basic clinical procedures and in- hospital emergency management skills, and adhere to clinical safety requirements 4 Interpret clinical findings, formulate differential diagnoses, select, justify and interpret common investigations, and identify and justify management options 5 Demonstrate knowledge of population health, social determinants of health, preventive health, epidemiology and surveillance 6 Interpret health care systems and the practice of medicine in the context of the health care system, and determine the roles of, and relationships between, health services 7 Communicate and work professionally, effectively and empathically with other health professionals 8 Exhibit professional and ethical behaviour and attitudes at all times in the clinical setting as is expected of medical practitioners Apply discipline knowledge, principles and concepts Innovative, creative and entrepreneurial Effective communicators with digital competency Globally engaged and responsive Culturally competent to engage respectfully with local First Peoples and other diverse cultures Industry connected and career capable Find out more about Curtin's Graduate Capabilities at the Learning Innovation and Teaching Excellence Centre (LITEC) website: litec.curtin.edu.au Faculty of Health Sciences Curtin Medical School    GMED4002 Medicine 4 Bentley Perth Campus 17 Jan 2023 Curtin Medical School, Faculty of Health Sciences Page: 3 of 13 CRICOS Provider Code 00301J The only authoritative version of this Unit Outline is to be found online in OASIS Clinical Placement During the year you will participate in clinical placements related to clinical disciplines of general medicine, surgery, general practice, paediatrics, obstetrics and gynaecology, and psychiatry. For students based in Perth, each discipline has a separate placement. For students based with the Rural Clinical School (RCSWA) the disciplines are experienced in an integrated longitudinal placement. Medicine provides you the opportunity to learn about the care and management of patients with chronic and acute illness, including diagnosis, investigations, screening and pharmacology. Surgery involves developing understanding of examination techniques, interventional  procedures, practical aspects of life support, and recognition of the surgical patient. In some cases this placement will involve exposure to various subspecialties of surgery dependent on placement site. General practice focusses your learning on patient- centered care and all the other disciplines as they present in primary health care within the community. Paediatrics will expose you to the many differences between child and adolescent patients compared to adults. In obstetrics and gynaecology you will consolidate your understanding of the female reproductive system with clinical exposure to normal function and dysfunction. Importantly you will gain experience in both normal childbirth, and complications associated with childbirth. Psychiatry allows you to experience the complexities of mental illness diagnosis and management. Furthermore, ongoing patient management and care often involves family members and/or patient advocates. Attendance at clinical placements is compulsory. During each of your clinical placements you are required to complete Workplace Based Assessment tasks, including reflections, and complete practical skills logs. Students will use the MyProgress ePortfolio for these. RCS students will follow the RCS approach, but are encouraged to complete the Curtin skills logs so that they have a longitudinal record across both year 4 and 5. Other learning activities You will attend four Back to Campus Weeks during the year (except for RCS students). These intensive and interactive weeks are an important opportunity for you to consolidate your learning, and identify any gaps in your learning. Attendance at Back to Campus weeks is compulsory for those students completing Year 4 in Perth and Peel Health Campus. Your attendance and contribution to the Back to Campus week activities will be monitored. It is a requirement that students unable to attend any Back to Campus activity contact the school to advise of their absence. Towards the end of the year all year 4 students are required to attend the face- to- face workshop Advanced Life Support Level 1. This is an Australian Resuscitation Council (ARC) course aimed at providing you with the knowledge and skills to manage the patient in the immediate period of crisis. This course prepares you for your Year 5 acute care placements. Any student who has already completed the course and can provide evidence of currency is not required to attend. There are online Embedded Modules that all Year 4 students are required to complete throughout the year (including RCS students). These online modules focus on Dermatology, Palliative Care, prescribing (National Prescribing Curriculum) and Cross- Placement Specific Learning Objectives in Ophthalmology. Ideally, these should be completed during the specified clinical placements. All Year 4 students (including RCS students) are also required to complete a number of formative assessment tasks during the year: l Formative written mid- year SBA test (online) l Prescribing Skills Assessment (online) l Blackboard e- quizzes l Workplace Based Assessment in each clinical placement   (RCS students complete the RCSWA WBA tasks) Students completing placements in Perth and Peel are also required to attend online and self- directed learning Faculty of Health Sciences Curtin Medical School    GMED4002 Medicine 4 Bentley Perth Campus 17 Jan 2023 Curtin Medical School, Faculty of Health Sciences Page: 4 of 13 CRICOS Provider Code 00301J The only authoritative version of this Unit Outline is to be found online in OASIS sessions in the Professional Identity Series and complete the associated activities. This program has been designed to promote personal and professional development. The Curtin Medical School Mentor Programme continues in Year 4. All students are required to meet with their mentor at least once during the year and document a record of the meeting via MyProgress. The Senior Citizen Partnership Programme also continues in Year 4. All students are required to visit their Senior Partner twice during the year and document these visits using the attendance log sheet available on Blackboard. For RCS students these visits may be conducted remotely. More information on this program can be found in the Year 3- 5 Senior Citizen Partnership Program which is available on Blackboard.

Assessment Assessment policy exemptions l ASPM2 (will override policy rule on 50% examinations) Assessment schedule *Please refer to the Late Assessment and the Assessment Extension sections below for specific details and conditions. Detailed information on assessment tasks 1. The objective structured clinical examination (OSCE) (50%) is a practical examination in which you will take part in a number of observed stations. In each station of the OSCE you may be asked to perform a clinical task or demonstrate your communication skill etc. The OSCEs are run across a two- three day period and each student typically has a total of 3 hours testing time across that period. 2. The end of year written examination (50%) will test application of content knowledge from the whole of  year 4. These written examinations are typically 3 hours each paper, with 2 papers per examination.

In order to pass the unit and progress to Year 5: 1.  Both the CMS OSCE and end of year written examination must be passed separately. To pass the OSCE, students must pass a minimum of 60% stations (e.g. 10 out of 16 stations), and achieve a final mark of 50 or more in the OSCE (reported on a scale of 0 to 100 with 50 as the pass mark). 2.  Students must also demonstrate satisfactory professional behaviour. Assessment of your professional behaviour includes monitoring of your attendance and completion of the required Year 4 activities.  Consistent poor attendance or non- completion of these tasks (or components) will be notified to the Curtin Medical School Behaviour and Registration Panel.   See MBBS Course- based Requirements for Assessment and Progression for further details. Curtin Medical School determines assessment and progression for ALL Curtin students, including RCSWA students.   Further Assessment If a student is granted a Further Assessment (FA) in the unit, passing the Further Assessment is a necessary component of passing the unit. An exemption to the Assessment Student Progression Manual has been granted – Combining the marks from FA (clinical skills examination and/or written examination) with the results from the main assessment (clinical skills examination and/or written examination) will determine whether the student has met the Unit Learning Outcomes and deemed eligible to pass the unit. The result of the Further Assessment by itself does not determine pass/fail of the Unit. Students are not required to accept the offer of Further Assessment. Faculty of Health Sciences Curtin Medical School    GMED4002 Medicine 4 Bentley Perth Campus 17 Jan 2023 Curtin Medical School, Faculty of Health Sciences Page: 6 of 13 CRICOS Provider Code 00301J The only authoritative version of this Unit Outline is to be found online in OASIS Assessment Moderation Fair assessment through moderation Moderation describes a quality assurance process to ensure that assessments are appropriate to the learning outcomes, and that students work is evaluated consistently by assessors.
