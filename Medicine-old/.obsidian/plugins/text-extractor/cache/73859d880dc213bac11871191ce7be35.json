{"path":"images/Untitled 5 3.png","text":"Janine, a 20-year-old female, has been brought in for review by a friend. Janine was at university sitting an exam that morning and uttered a high pitched cry, fell to the ground and had purpose-less movements for about 10 minutes. During that time she could answer yes-no to questions. Her colour was Â£00d and she actively resisted when one of the invigilators attempted to roll her into the recovery position once the movements had settled. She did not become incontinent and after the 10 minutes was able to get up, give her friend's phone number and wait until the friend came to collect her. Examination was unremarkable and Janine appeared alert and orientated to place and time. What is the most appropriate immediate management?","libVersion":"0.2.4","langs":"eng"}
