PaO2 typically remains normal. * When true S;0, is >85% you get a falsely LOW S,0, reading * If the true S,0, is actually <85%, S,0, will be falsely HIGH » Causes: prilocaine/benzocaine topicalization, metoclopramide, dapsone, nitric oxide, nitroglycerine * Treatments: methylene blue, vitamin C (in G6PD deficiency) + Carboxyhemoglobin (COHb) - Similar absorbance to O,Hb. Higher affinity to Hgb than 02 * At 50% COHb, S,0, may be 95% despite a low S,0, = 50% on ABG, thus producing a falsely HIGH S 0, » Causes: smoke inhalation, volatile anesthetic degradation, desiccated baralyme/soda lime * Treatments: 100% FiO2, hyperbaric 02 » Cyanide toxicity: Clinical cyanosis despite HIGH SpO2. ABG and VBG will show similar PO2 values due to uncoupling of oxidative phosphorylation. Lactate will be very high. * Hgb remains oxygenated, but tissues cannot use it » Causes: sodium nitroprusside, smoke inhalation * Treatment: hydroxocobalamin (previously sodium/amyl nitrite)","libVersion":"0.2.4","langs":"eng"}
