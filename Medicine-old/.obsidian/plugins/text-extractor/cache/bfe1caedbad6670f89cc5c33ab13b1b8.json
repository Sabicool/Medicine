For persistent wheeze Bronchodilators: Salbutamol 8-12 puffs of 100microgram (spacer) or 5mg (nebuliser). Note: Bronchodilators must not be used as first line medication for anaphylaxis as they do not prevent or relieve upper airway obstruction, hypotension or shock. Corticosteroids: Oral prednisolone 1 mg/kg (maximum of 50 mg) or intravenous hydrocortisone 5 mg/kg (maximum of 200 mg). Note: Steroids must not be used as a first line medication in place of adrenaline as the benefit of corticosteroids in anaphylaxis is unproven.","libVersion":"0.2.4","langs":"eng"}
