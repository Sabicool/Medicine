Key examination findings are a hazy cornea and a fixed mid-dilated (or mid- position) pupil, meaning an irregularly semi- dilated pupil which is not reactive to light. AACG occurs due to occlusion of the anterior chamber angle most commonly by apposition of the posterior iris with the lens, thus preventing aqueous drainage and causing increased Toji = TeYelV | ETa o] (=ET1 VI (=W 2T i k= Ye (o) -l g [o] (W [ ) oL=1 (o] oI - MTlel (=F- Y=Y I=To LW =T o g o1 (= Wa [T g Yo [T = T o east asian descent.
