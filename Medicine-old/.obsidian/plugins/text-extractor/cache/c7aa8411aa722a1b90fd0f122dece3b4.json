Some patient groups are at high risk of acute heuratic fever = Ask aboLtt the patient or carer's expectations for management of streptococeal phanyngtis and tonsilitis = Explain that there are two treatrment approaches « Symptomatic therapy alone with follow-up if symptorns do not improve within a reasonable timeframe (eg3 to 7 days), or if symptorts worsen or new symptorns develop (egvormiting, defydration, rigors) at any time. A delayed prescription for antibiotic therapy can be offered if the patiert will not be able to retun « Symptomatic therapy plus an immediate prescription for artibiotic therapy. = Explain that symptorns of streptococcal phanmgiis and tonsilitis usualy last 7 days, whether or not antibiotics are used = Discuss the limited benefits of artibiotic therapy, even when a bacterial cause is likely. « Antibiotics only shorten the duration of symptorns by less than 1 day. « Antibiotics can prevent acute rheurmatic fever, but this is a rare complication of streptococcal nfection in patients who are not in a high-risk group = Discuss the potential harms of antibiotic therapy. o Adverse effects of antibiotics include diarroea, rash or more serious hypersensitivity reactions « Antibiotics disrupt the balance of bacteria in the body (the rricrobiorne). While the consequences of this are not fully understood, it can cause problems ranging from yeast infections (egthrush) to more serious infections (eg Clostridior difiile [formerly known as Clostridiurn diffci] infection). « Antibiotics can cause bacteria in the body to become resistant to artibiotics so that future infections are harder to treat. Multidrug-resistant bacteria (known as ‘superbugs’) can be spread between people, affecting other family merbers and the commmurnity. = Ask about the preferences, values and concers of the patiert or carer, and answer ay remaining questions = Make a joint decision about whether to use symptomatio therapy alone or combine symptormatic therapy with antibiotic therapy [NB1] [NB2]; if a decision is made to use antibiotic therapy, see Antibiotic therapy for streptococeal pharyngitis and tonsilits for treatment recommendations. = Discuss criteria for patient follow-up and reassessment. Ask the patient to retum if symptoms (particularly fever) do not improve within a reasonable timeframe (eg 3 to 7 days), or if symptoms worsen or new symptorns develop (egvomiting, dehydration, rigors) at anv time.
