Although other emergencies take precedence over pronouncing a patient dead, try not to postpone this task for too long, as the time of death is legally the time at which you see and then pronounce the patient dead. It also allows the nursing staff to begin organising the numerous notifications and procedures required once death has been certified.
# Expected Deaths
1. Review the medical notes to obtain the background to this event
2. Identify the patient by the hospital identification tag worn on the wrist or leg
3. Ascertain that the patient does not rouse to verbal or tactile stimuli
4. Look and listen for absent spontaneous respirations
5. Listen for absent heart sounds and feel for an absent carotid pulse
6. Look for absent pupillary reactions to light
7. Record the time at which your assessment was *completed*
8. Document your findings

> [!EXAMPLE] 
> Called to pronounce Mr X deceased. Patient unresponsive to verbal or tactile stimuli. No heart sounds heard, no pulse felt. No spontaneous respirations observed and no air entry heart. Pupils fixed and dilated. Patient pronounced dead at 20:30 hours, 11 December 2024

9. Informing the family
	- When the death is expected, the relatives will usually have been notified to come to hospital
	- Notify the next of kin as soon as possible unless documented otherwise
	- It is best to call the family in to the hospital to break bad news but if the death was expected to occur, a phone call may be reasonable
	- If possible, a doctor familiar with the patient, or a senior nurse who knows the family well, should notify the next of kin
	- Breaking the news over the phone:
		1. First familiarise yourself with the patient's medical history and cause of death
		2. Speak to the nursing staff who are familiar with the family in case there are difficult family situations or potential problems
		3. When calling, identify yourself and ask for the immediate next of kin
		4. Deliver the message clearly: *I am sorry to inform you that your husband died at 8:30 this evening*
		5. Say that the relative has died peacefully: *As you know, your husband was suffering from a terminal illness. Although I was not with your husband at the time of his death, the nurses looking after him assure me that he was comfortable and that he passed away peacefully*
		6. Ask the next of kin if they wish to come to the hospital to see their loved one for one last time and encourage them to do so. Inform the nurse of this decision
		7. Questions pertaining to funeral arrangements and the patient's personal belongings are best referred to the nurse in charge or to the social worker to be sorted out in the morning
		8. Autopsy or tissue donation should be introduced during face-to-face contact and could be deferred to the patient's usual medical team in the morning
