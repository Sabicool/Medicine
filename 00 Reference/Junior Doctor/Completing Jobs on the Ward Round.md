- Your priority during the ward round should be to document
	- Hopefully you would have prepped for the ward round before hand
- Try to do most simple jobs during the ward round
	- Consider completing the following jobs during the ward round
		- Discharges/updating them
		- Ordering everything, including Imaging, Bloods and the various Nurse assisted Investigations, such as urines, swabs. 
		- Consult request forms (harder as they take longer and lock you from the rest of eMR for a while, but get them ready in Word on an aside)
		- Consents
		- Medical Handover forms (as above)
		- Charting Meds (e.g. the newly initiated, warfarin, prednisone, insulin)
		- Charting Fluids
		- Script writing/Outpatient forms/Med Certs/other forms the Nurses want
	- Hopefully you have set up your investigations (see [[Ordering Investigations]])
- Consider preparation for other jobs
	- e.g. Cardio consult => cardiology letters needed => ask the patient now which cardiologist they see and in which rooms
- Can consider also having multiple windows open:
	- The patient at hand
	- The patient soonest to be discharged and not prepped so that while there are delays (e.g. patient answering questions or the registrar is examining) you can finish documenting, finish jobs and commence discharges (parts which don't require much thinking)
	- Can also start taking a look and prepping the notes for the next patient to be seen
