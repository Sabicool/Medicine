- Your priority during the ward round should be to document
	- Hopefully you would have prepped for the ward round before hand
- Try to do most simple jobs during the ward round
	- Consider completing the following jobs during the ward round
		- Discharges/updating them
		- Ordering everything, including Imaging, Bloods and the various Nurse assisted Investigations, such as urines, swabs. 
		- Consult request forms (harder as they take longer and lock you from the rest of eMR for a while, but get them ready in Word on an aside)
		- Consents
		- Medical Handover forms (as above)
		- Charting Meds (e.g. the newly initiated, warfarin, prednisone, insulin)
		- Charting Fluids
		- Script writing/Outpatient forms/Med Certs/other forms the Nurses want
	- Hopefully you have set up your investigations (see [[Ordering Investigations]])
- Consider preparation for other jobs
		- e.g. Cardio consult => cardiology letters needed => ask the patient now which cardiologist they see and in which rooms
