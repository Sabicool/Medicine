- Important considerations
	- As in [[Preparing for a Term]] but particular emphasis on
		- Very portable water bottle
		- Food to have while walking
	- Sit everywhere
	- Phone orders: You can start treatments before physically getting there by ordering on the phone as a STAT order
	- Eating
		- For evening shifts eat at the beginning of your shift as you'll unlikely have time during the rest of the time
		- For night shifts have a routine that works (e.g. snack/hydrate around 1am, meal at 4am, snack/hydrate at 7am)
	- Timing
		- During nights the main job rush hour comes at about 10pm to 1am then again at about 6:30am to 8am because that is when the nurses have changed shift and the new nurses identify new tasks for the JMOs
		- Therefore to save repetitive walking you can wait until 11:30pm to do all the jobs in a clean sweep by ward
	- Know which wards you cover
- EMR setup
	- Have the following lists
		- Ward lists
		- Whole of hospital list, this is helpful to scan through if called or paged about a patient and at least you'll know if they're in the hospital
		- Multi-patient task list
		- Task manager
		- After hours custom list
- Organising after hours jobs
