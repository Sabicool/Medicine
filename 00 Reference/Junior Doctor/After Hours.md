- Important considerations
	- As in [[Preparing for a Term]] but particular emphasis on
		- Very portable water bottle
		- Food to have while walking
	- Sit everywhere
	- Phone orders: You can start treatments before physically getting there by ordering on the phone as a STAT order
	- Eating
		- For evening shifts eat at the beginning of your shift as you'll unlikely have time during the rest of the time
		- For night shifts have a routine that works (e.g. snack/hydrate around 1am, meal at 4am, snack/hydrate at 7am)
	- Timing
		- During nights the main job rush hour comes at about 10pm to 1am then again at about 6:30am to 8am because that is when the nurses have changed shift and the new nurses identify new tasks for the JMOs
		- Therefore to save repetitive walking you can wait until 11:30pm to do all the jobs in a clean sweep by ward
	- Know which wards you cover
- Preparation
	- EMR setup
		- Have the following lists
			- Ward lists
			- Whole of hospital list, this is helpful to scan through if called or paged about a patient and at least you'll know if they're in the hospital
			- Multi-patient task list
			- Task manager
			- After hours custom list
		- Have all your auto-texts ready
	- Things
		- Always carry a notebook or some paper at least
			- Whenever a call comes, you can easily note down everything the other party can tell you, know the patient's condition, start to address the issues, remember what investigations and treatment you've commenced and importantly follow up and eventually hand over
- Prioritising after hours jobs
	1. MET Calls/Rapid Resonses
	2. Clinical reviews
	3. Organisation
		- First go through the multi-patient task list then the task manager and assess the urgency of the jobs
	4. Verbal handover from any doctors about urgent things
	5. Multi-patient task list: Handover tasks
	6. Task manager/JMO job books: the rest of the jobs
