# Code Blue (Medical Emergency)
- Usually called to avert the risk of cardiac arrest but some hospitals may only call this in response to cardiac arrest
# Code Black (Personal Threat)
- A Code Black should be activated while staying out of danger. In certain circumstances, attempting to calm the aggressor may be appropriate, depending on the potential danger, the person's level of arousal and the precipitating event.
# Code Red (Fire/Smoke)
