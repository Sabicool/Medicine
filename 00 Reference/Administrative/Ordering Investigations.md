> Always order from the scrachpad ([[Home Screen]]) using favourites
- Once you've set up a favourite, the order will be made in the same way and needs only your signature to complete
- Setting up favoruites:
	1. Get tests: search for the tests you want to favourite in scratchpad
	2. Order when found click the sign button (top right corner; envelope with a number indicating the number of tests ordered)
	3. Input data; fill in data how you want it daily
		- If they're the same class of test (e.g. blood also highlight or click and drag them all and input once for their common fields e.g. clinician collect y/n or date/time or hold+control and select the same classes)
		- Leave blank the sections which need adjusting each time e.g. patient weight for MRIs
	4. Add to favourites
		- Highlight the tests in the list of orders that you want to put into one folder -> right click -> select add to favourites
	5. Generate folders
		- Click create folders and create various useful categories and place those selected tests in the appropriate folders:

# Custom Order
- For times when the favourite might not work and you need to order something slightly different
- Same way as usual order except click modify instead of sign after you click the scratchpad sign button
	- Takes you to the standard orders page and you can modify whatever needs modifying
- To change the whole standard (e.g. changing terms, pager changes or in ED when everything becomes clinician collect)
	- Go to order tab -> click add -> under the star button -> click down arrow -> click modify favourites -> now you can add or delete as needed
	- Unfortunately, you can’t directly modify the ‘Favourite’ you’ve already saved, so you’ll need to delete the old ‘Favourite’ and recreate it via the whole process
