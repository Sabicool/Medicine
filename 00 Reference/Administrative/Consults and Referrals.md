# Preparation Before the Consult
- Prepare adequately but not obsessively; consider 
	- Preparing the discharge
	- Everything is up to date 
	- Patient information is in front of you including med charts, letters, and every investigation
- Know what your team wants
	- What your team's question is
- Always better to refer early with a poorer presentation
