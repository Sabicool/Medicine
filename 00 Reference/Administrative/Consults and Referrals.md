# Preparation Before the Consult
- Prepare adequately but not obsessively; consider 
	- Preparing the discharge
	- Everything is up to date 
	- Patient information is in front of you including med charts, letters, and every investigation
- Know what your team wants
	- What your team's question is
	- Whether you want phone or in-person consult
	- Urgency of the consult
- Have at hand the relevant history, examination, investigations and management
	- Consider if you were the consulted registrar, what you would like to know
- Find any external documents
	- Investigations/procedures in hospital
		- Echos/angiograms often in the department and not uploaded until post discharge
		- ECGs often in the paper file
		- Insulin charts often at the bedside
		- Scopes often in clinical notes only under endoscopy reports
	- External investigations/procedures -> Call for pretty much everything
	- Ask the patient if these have been done and if they have it in a folder
- Do a practice run of the consult in your head making sure the opening is good
- Prep a discharge for the consult; at least the issue relating to the consult
	- You can avoid notes and results trawling and realise any holes in your current assessment
- Always better to refer early with a poorer presentation

# Finding the Consult Number
- Often consulting a team takes a while for the other consulted team to respond
- Always have paperwork or something you can do while waiting for the consulted team to respond (e.g. discharges, pathology orders (although do not lock yourself out of eMR), your own overtime sheet)
- Start by trying to page the consulted team
- Text/Whatsapp/Teams the reg
- Text/page the team JMO
- Switch to transfer to mobile
- Document simply 'paged XXX reg XXX times, will try again'
# The Actual Consult
1. Introduce yourself: 'I am one of the new interns on (ward/specialty)'
2. Correct reg: 'Are you on for Consults?'
3. Question - Specialty Specific: Always start with the Question
	- Keep it short; usually on sentence e.g. This is a consult regarding XXX, are you able to help me with this where XXX can be optimal antibiotic regime for XXX infection or optimisation of CCF management or drainage of pleural effusion for XXX
	- Keep the question clear: Know exactly what you want from the Consulted Team (i.e. what you want them to do; 'see the patient' is not enough)
		- If your team has no question in particular, just ask for optimisation of the management of (medical condition) or diagnostic dilemma of (something related to the Consulted Team's system)
	- Keep it relevant
4. Patient Name/Patient Record Number/Identifier
5. Spiel
	- Typically better to follow the long case format (HxPc, PMHx etc.) and keep it relevant to the consulted specialty
	- Start your spiel only for that specialty e.g. 'This is a (age) old female/male presenting with/who has (condition) Â± complicated by (condition), on a background of (two or three major comorbidities) with (any other extra important information)'
		- HxPC: one sentence on why the patient's in hospital, then talk in detail about the consulted problem
		- PMHx: Generally include everything but mention matters that are related to the consulted system first
			- Also include the relevant consultant if the patient is already known to someone in the consulted specialty
		- Medications: tailor to specialty and name the important ones first
		- Other history: e.g. social history, mobility status, ADLs and home supports for Geris
