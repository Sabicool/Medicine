# Preparation Before the Consult
- Prepare adequately but not obsessively; consider 
	- Preparing the discharge
	- Everything is up to date 
	- Patient information is in front of you including med charts, letters, and every investigation
- Know what your team wants
	- What your team's question is
	- Whether you want phone or in-person consult
	- Urgency of the consult
- Have at hand the relevant history, examination, investigations and management
	- Consider if you were the consulted registrar, what you would like to know
- Do a practice run of the consult in your head making sure the opening is good
- Prep a discharge for the consult; at least the issue relating to the consult
	- You can avoid notes and results trawling and realise any holes in your current assessment
	- 
- Always better to refer early with a poorer presentation
