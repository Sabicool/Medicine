# Setting Up a List
1. Click ‘Patient List’ (top Toolbar): A List will pop up
2. Press the Spanner in top left: A pop-up will appear with two columns
3. Press ‘New’ button in bottom right
- From here two columns should appear; the left is the categories and the right is the subcategories
- Specific lists are outline below
## After Hours (Based on Location)
- Set up ward lists for each ward that you're covering
1. Double click 'Location' for 'Patient List Type'
2. Keep expanding the ‘Locations’ folder on the right column until specific enough
3. Choose the Hospital→Choose the Ward
4. Go to ‘Discharged Criteria’ (left column)→Various options appear on the right→Check ‘Only display patients that have not been Discharged’→Click ‘Finish’
5. Move that Ward List from ‘Available Lists’ to ‘Active Lists’ with the arrows
## Home Team (Based on Consultants)
1. Double click ‘Provider Group’ for the ‘Patient List Type’→Two columns appear
2. In the right column→Check all the Bosses your Team has
3. Now click ‘Locations’ (lef column)→‘Location List’ appears on the right→ Check your Hospital (right column). Remember that this is for inpatients only; avoid clicking ‘Clinics’ unless you see them there
4. You may also need to go to ‘Encounter type’ (lef column) and check ‘Inpatients’ only
5. Go to ‘Discharged Criteria’ (lef column)→Various options appear on the right →Check ‘Only display patients that have not been Discharged’
6. Name your List at ‘Enter a name for the List:’
7. Click ‘Next’ if you wish to proxy people (see section ‘List maintenance’)
8. Done: You now have an auto-populating List of patients who are all under your Bosses. Your List will now self-update at will and patients will of themselves appear and disappear from it as soon as they are Admitted or Discharged
- You can also choose ‘Medical Service’ (lef column) for Medical Terms with only one Team, e.g. choose ‘Endocrinology’ as the ‘Service’ and follow the above scheme instead of ‘Provider Group’ or any other method as you require
	- But you cannot add or remove any patients from it, hence patients your team has TOC'ed are annoying as you need to wait for the ward clerk to update the system and discharged patients are annoying as they vanish (unless you change the discharge criteria to discharged in the last xxx days to find them again)
	- Additionally consults can't be added either
## Custom List
- You get the ability to add or delete patients from the list at will but it won't do anything automatically
1. Double click 'Custom for the 'Patient List Type'
2. Enter a Name and hit 'Finish' -> Done
- Can use it as a team list by copying all patients from the auto-populating one (medical service one above) and then adding patients to it for whatever purpose (e.g. consults, after hours, follow-up) and remove them if you no longer need them
## Consultant List
- Create this list when the registrar says "[consultant name] is rounding today"
- First sort the List based on Location, then Consultant (click each column heading); then simply highlight, right click and select ‘Hide’ for all patients not under the Rounding Consultant
