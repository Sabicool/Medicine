		- Medical imaging for scans
		- Microbiology for bugs
		- Patient care results for nurse inputted data
	- Searching individual results:
		- Click the '...' button next ot flowsheet just under the results row of tabs at the top
	- Navigator
		- Next to the list of Results there’s a contents panel called Navigator  with all the categories, e.g. Blood Gases or Coagulation Studies; very useful to jump between Results
