# Getting into the Training Program
- For NSW is fairly competitive and need 1-2 years of SRMO before getting onto non-scheme anaesthetic job; need to apply for a scheme job as well that goes through the rest of the training requirements
- Express interest to the anaesthetics department
- Good references from supervisors during JMO/SRMO years
- Research output specific to anaesthetics but research isn't as emphasised in comparison to surgery
- Courses specific for critical care and anaesthetics: ALS2, airway short courses
- Masters in traumatology less beneficial
